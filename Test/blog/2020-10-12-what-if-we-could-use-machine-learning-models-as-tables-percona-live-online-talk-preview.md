_[Percona Live Online Agenda](https://www.percona.com/live/agenda) Slot: Tue 20 Oct • New York 1:30 p.m. • London 6:30 p.m. • New Delhi 11:00 p.m. • Singapore 1:30 a.m. (next day)_

### Abstract

In most machine learning tasks, one has to first organize data in some form and then turn it into information about the problem that needs to be solved. One could say that the requirement to train many machine learning algorithms is information, not just data. Given that most of the world's structured and semi-structured data (information) lives in databases, it makes sense to bring ML capabilities straight to the databases themselves. In this talk we want to present to the Percona community what we have learned in the effort of enabling existing databases like MariaDB and Postgres with frictionless ML powers.

### Why is your talk exciting?

ML straight in databases is exciting because it enables hundreds of thousands of people that already know SQL to solve problems using machine learning without any extra skills.

### Who would benefit the most from your talk?

Anyone knows how to query a SQL database.

### Is there any other question you would like to answer?

What databases can we do machine learning in now, and which ones are coming?

### What other talks are you most looking forward to?
