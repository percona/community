Our authors
-----------

[Percona's Community Blog](https://www.percona.com/community-blog/) welcomes authors on all manner of open source database topics. It's not just about Percona software.  But it must lead with databases, not have databases as a subordinate aspect.  It must be highly relevant to databases.

Who may publish?
----------------

All database professionals are invited. You might post here from time to time, even just once and done. Or you might enjoy showcasing a recurring column, even if you don’t want to commit to a predictable publishing schedule. If you already blog, you can cross-post content here.

I don’t know enough!
--------------------

Expert level content is always welcome, but so is content for entry level readers. Even if you are new to a subject, but have researched and found a solution, it’s quite likely that others would benefit from knowing what you learned.

I don’t write well enough!
--------------------------

It’s the ideas, knowledge exchange and sharing that matters. Percona can work on tidying up your writing if needed. You always get final approval before we publish anything done under your name.

What about copyright and licensing?
-----------------------------------

Assuming your content is original work, you own the copyright. From the perspective of it being on the Community Blog, the default license we adopt is [Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) as [summarized here](https://www.percona.com/community-blog/2018/06/01/content-license/).

What about syndicated content?
------------------------------

This is welcomed. In terms of licensing, the license from your originally published piece will be inherited. Be certain you have the right to share the work. We will add links to your own blog in your author profile, enabling you to reach a new audience.

What’s the catch?
-----------------

No catch really. You’re helping Percona with content, while we're helping you to showcase and share it. It’s a win win that endures. Some of our most popular posts are years old and still have traction.

Interested?
