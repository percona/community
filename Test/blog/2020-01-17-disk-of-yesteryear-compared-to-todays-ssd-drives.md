In my [last blog post](https://www.percona.com/
community-blog/2019/08/01/how-to-build-a-percona-server-stack-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/) I showed you how to get the entire Percona “Stack" up and running on a Raspberry Pi. This time around, I would like to show the impact on performance between using an SSD hard disk and a standard hard disk. 

Disk performance is a key factor in [Percona Server for MySQL](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) (or any RDB platform) performance on a Raspberry Pi 4.

Test set up
-----------

Each test below was run three times per Hard Disk and I took the best of the three for comparison. Hardware

*   Raspberry Pi 4+ with 4GB ram.
*   Disk 1: USB3 Western Digital My Passport Ultra, 1TB
*   Disk 2: USB3 KEXIN 240GB Portable External SSD Drive

Hardware stayed consistent during test, except for the hard disk that were switched from KEXIN to Western Digital drive. Software

*   Raspbian Buster
*   Persona Server Version: 5.7.27-30 built from source. See the above BLOG for install instructions.
*   Sysbench 1.0.17

Sysbench MySQL test prep step:

/usr/share/sysbench/tests/include/oltp_legacy/parallel_prepare.lua run
```

Test 1
------

This was done using the: KEXIN 240GB Portable External SSD Drive. Sysbench command:
```
sysbench --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=sbtest --report-interval=2 --mysql-table-engine=innodb --oltp-table-size=500000 --oltp-tables-count=10 --oltp-test-mode=complex --threads=10 --time=150 —mysql-host= --mysql-port=3306 —mysql-user= —mysql-password= /usr/share/sysbench/tests/include/oltp_legacy/oltp.lua run
```
Output:

```
As you can see the performance with the KEXIN (SSD) Drive was pretty good:
```
transactions:                        34753  (231.62 per sec.)
queries:                             695060 (4632.45 per sec.)

```

Test 2
------

This was done using the: Western Digital My Passport Ultra 1TB drive.

```
As you can see the performance on the Western Digital Drive was really bad:
```
transactions:                        4356   (29.00 per sec.)
queries:                             87120  (579.94 per sec.)

Conclusion
----------

As you can see the transactions per second between the Western Digital Drive and the KEXIN Drive was more than 12.5% slower. The queries per second between the Western Digital Drive and KEXIN drive were more than 12.5% slower. Even the sysbench showed an extreme difference between the two drives. There is a 13.36ms difference in the 95% percentile. KEXIN:
```
transactions:                        34753  (231.62 per sec.)
queries:                             695060 (4632.45 per sec.)

```
Western Digital:
```
transactions:                        4356   (29.00 per sec.)
queries:                             87120  (579.94 per sec.)

```
With the cost of SSD drives dropping, we can see that the Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB with an SSD drive is a good choice for a small business (or anyone) that needs a good robust database at an affordable price range.
