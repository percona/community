      "Bio 2": "",
      "Description": "Block device incidents are frequent and frightening in production. To achieve high availability, distributed databases usually have fault tolerant strategies to handle these incidents. As the system gets more complicated, it's even hard to prove whether these strategies are working. For example, if the execution and distribution of scheduling commands also depend on the hanging storage, it will have no effect.\n\nIn order to help developers verify the performance of their databases under storage disasters, we designed a Linux IO scheduler called IOEM to emulate the properties of block devices.\n\nIOEM allows developers to specify latency and IOPS per block device and process, making it possible to emulate a complex cluster with limited resources.  Developers can emulate a wide range of properties of storage devices with little overhead. Besides the incidents, IOEM can also be used to measure the performance of databases under low-end storage devices.\n\nIn this talk, Yang Keao will show a real-world example where the fault-tolerant strategies failed, and how they reproduced them in the development environment with the help of IOEM. He will also introduce the structure and implementation of IOEM, compare it with other implementation of block device latency injection, and describe the convenience it will bring to the development of databases.",

Dive into the different reasons behind that and how you can overcome all issues that you might face in your database. This video is going through the best practices:\n- Always follow proper and systematic approach while initiating your troubleshooting\n- The reasons behind slowdown and performance issues, the root causes and symptoms\n- Few PMM dashboards, Percona Monitoring and Management dashboards, which is our open source monitoring tool to help identify where the issues could arise\n- Exploring query Analytics\n- Need for scalability\n- And last, but not the least, is improving the best practices",

His primary focus was on system-level embedded development. After joining EnterpriseDB in 2006, an Enterprise PostgreSQL company, he started his career in open source development, specifically in PostgreSQL. He has contributed to the PostgreSQL community as well as other open source communities. His contribution ranges from the main performance feature enhancements to various PostgreSQL modules. In the database field, he has experience in other well-known databases MySQL, Oracle, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Hadoop. His expertise is not limited to core databases but with the tools related to databases like Hive, HBase, and Spark. He also worked on integrating these tools with PostgreSQL. \n\nIbrar gave more than fifteen PostgreSQL talks in the last year in various parts of the World (PostgreConf-EU, PostgreConf-ASIA,  PostgreConf-NY, Percona Lives, FOSDEM, etc.). He also authored multiple books on PostgreSQL. \n\n\n\n",

      "Description": "Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are intertwined capabilities that attempt to solve problems that defy traditional computational solutions --- problems including fraud detection, voice recognition, and search result recommendations. While they elude simple computation, they are computationally expensive, involving the calculation of perhaps millions of probabilities and weights. These computations can be done outside the database, but there are specific advantages of doing machine learning inside it, close to where the data is stored. This presentation explains how to do machine learning inside the Postgres database.\n",
