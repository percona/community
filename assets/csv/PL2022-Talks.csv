What if we could access these databases using strong identities and zero-trust principles?<br><br>That's exactly what you can do quickly and easily using OpenZiti's zero trust JDBC. Not only can you add the OpenZiti JDBC directly to your app for zero-trust access, but you can <em>also</em> add it to your favorite SQL editors and access the DB over a zero-trust overlay network with no VPN. Who wants to turn on the VPN just to run a query?",Classroom 202 M2,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data protection with RAID 10 uses excessive redundancy in array mirroring, wasting significant capacity, while RAID 5/6 schemes penalize storage performance. All existing technologies have extensive rebuild times that are beyond acceptable risk levels. Pliops Extreme Data Processor using new data structures and algorithms change these dynamics to increase storage reliability with higher endurance, ultrafast rebuilds, and consistent performance. The presentation discusses how to enable these capabilities, including demonstrating how quickly a high-capacity SSD can rebuild with minimal impact on performance.",Classroom 202 M2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
