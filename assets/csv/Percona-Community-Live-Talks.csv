Emulate Block Device Incidents With IO Scheduler,Yang Keao,PingCAP,"Yang Keao is a developer at PingCAP and a maintainer of Chaos Mesh, a
cloud native chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes. He also helps the
database developers and QA team to promote the stability of TiDB, which
is a distributed database developed by PingCAP.",,,,"Block device incidents are frequent and frightening in production. To achieve high availability, distributed databases usually have fault tolerant strategies to handle these incidents. As the system gets more complicated, it's even hard to prove whether these strategies are working. For example, if the execution and distribution of scheduling commands also depend on the hanging storage, it will have no effect.

In order to help developers verify the performance of their databases under storage disasters, we designed a Linux IO scheduler called IOEM to emulate the properties of block devices.

IOEM allows developers to specify latency and IOPS per block device and process, making it possible to emulate a complex cluster with limited resources.  Developers can emulate a wide range of properties of storage devices with little overhead. Besides the incidents, IOEM can also be used to measure the performance of databases under low-end storage devices.


In this talk, Yang Keao will show a real-world example where the fault-tolerant strategies failed, and how they reproduced them in the development environment with the help of IOEM. He will also introduce the structure and implementation of IOEM, compare it with other implementation of block device latency injection, and describe the convenience it will bring to the development of databases.",June 21,2022-06-21 09:00:00,"Jun 21, 9:00 AM","Jun 21, 15:00 ",,,,

",,,,"Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are intertwined capabilities that attempt to solve problems that defy traditional computational solutions --- problems including fraud detection, voice recognition, and search result recommendations. While they elude simple computation, they are computationally expensive, involving the calculation of perhaps millions of probabilities and weights. These computations can be done outside the database, but there are specific advantages of doing machine learning inside it, close to where the data is stored. This presentation explains how to do machine learning inside the Postgres database.
