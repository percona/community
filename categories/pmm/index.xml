Why should I care about database monitoring?

But if I am writing it, I would like to test that what I wrote works. I often found myself copy-pasting something from documentation and trying to run it in the terminal (commands, files, etc.), and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
There are usually some environment, typos, or even wrong commands in the doc (that people copy-pasted from the wrong place).
I know that issue, and after writing the documentation, I usually try to clean up everything in my environment and test the doc.</description></item><item><title>Percona Monitoring and Management 2.35 preview release</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/14/preview-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/14/preview-release/</guid><description>Percona Monitoring and Management 2.35 preview release Hello folks!

But the open source world is extensive and diverse, and everyone can find their place there. Your project will benefit from various experiences that non-coders can bring to the table. Isnât that cool when you receive an issue with an interesting bug from the community, read about a user case in a blog or a review, or someone makes a video guide for your product?</description></item><item><title>Node metrics available inside of a container</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/06/node-metrics-container/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/06/node-metrics-container/</guid><description>Several people asked me this question: Could we get Node metrics inside of a container?
Usually, this comes from the fact that PMM or standalone people run node_exporter inside a container. PMM does it as a sidecar along with many other exporters to monitor DBs, and node_exporter comes out of the box as a default one. So people could see accurate data on dashboards, like Memory and CPU, that node_exporter reads inside the container.</description></item><item><title>Percona Monitoring and Management 2.34 preview release</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/17/preview-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/17/preview-release/</guid><description>Percona Monitoring and Management 2.34 preview release Hello folks!

In future blog posts, we&amp;rsquo;ll provide some insight on how to contribute to our software but&amp;hellip; the beauty of documentation is that it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward to maintain, and you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to be a programmer to be able to provide valuable corrections and enhancements.</description></item></channel></rss>
