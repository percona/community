I mean we clone sheep, we can clone human organs in time we might be able to clone humans, but thats a topic for scientist and philosophers.
What is MySQL Replicaion:
The MySQL clone plugin can be used to replicate data from a MySQL server to another MySQL server, and it supports replication. The cloning process creates a physical snapshot of the data, including tables, schemas, tablespaces, and data dictionary metadata.</description></item><item><title>Reduce Replication Lag</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/06/01/speed-up-replication-lag/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/06/01/speed-up-replication-lag/</guid><description>Replication Lag is just a fact of life with async-replication. We can&amp;rsquo;t stop lag, but we can help to reduce it. Many times the Seconds_Behind_Source can be very deciving, I have seen it go from 1 hour behind to 0 lag in the blink of an eye. There are many factors that can add to replica lag. Some of these are:
Network IO Disk IO Database Workload Database settings In this blog we will look a few database settings to help reduce lag.</description></item><item><title>The Errant GTID</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/11/08/the-errant-gtid-pt1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/11/08/the-errant-gtid-pt1/</guid><description>Part 1 What is a GTID? Oracle/MySQL define a GTID as "A global transaction identifier (GTID) is a unique identifier created and associated with each transaction committed on the server of origin (the source). This identifier is unique not only to the server on which it originated, but is unique across all servers in a given replication topology." An errant transaction can make promotion of a replica to primary very difficult.</description></item><item><title>An Introduction To MongoDB Replication</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/01/14/introduction-mongodb-replication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 11:21:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/01/14/introduction-mongodb-replication/</guid><description>MongoDB® is database software that stores data in the same format as JSON. The data structure of the database can be changed when required. The performance of the database is good and developers can easily use to it to connect their code to the database.
The database, MongoDB is platform independent and runs in the same way on all platforms. It is an open source database and is based on a document-oriented database model.</description></item><item><title>Multi-master with MariaDB 10 - a tutorial</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/10/multi-master-with-mariadb-10-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:57:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/10/multi-master-with-mariadb-10-tutorial/</guid><description>The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to use multi-master to aggregate databases with the same name, but different data from different masters, on the same slave.
Example:
master1 =&amp;gt; a French subsidiary master2 =&amp;gt; a British subsidiary Both have the same database PRODUCTION but the data are totally different.
This screenshot is made from my own monitoring tool: PmaControl. You have to read 10.10.16.232 on master2 and not 10.</description></item><item><title>7 Checks to Successfully Upgrade MongoDB Replica Set in Production</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/08/29/7-checks-successfully-upgrade-mongodb-replica-set-production/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2018 10:23:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/08/29/7-checks-successfully-upgrade-mongodb-replica-set-production/</guid><description>MongoDB ships powerful features in each release. The new release brings new features while revisions add bug fixes, security patches or improvements to existing features. To bring most out these releases to your plate you should always consider upgrading your MongoDB deployments.
Planning your database upgrade can avoid the nightmares caused due to database-upgrade-gone-wrong or avoid not-so-simple rollbacks in your production database. Grab a cup of coffee and sit back. This blog post explains the few important to have items on your checklist to plan MongoDB replica set upgrades.</description></item><item><title>Question about Semi-Synchronous Replication: the Answer with All the Details</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/08/23/question-about-semi-synchronous-replication-answer-with-all-the-details/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 12:49:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/08/23/question-about-semi-synchronous-replication-answer-with-all-the-details/</guid><description>I was recently asked a question by mail about MySQL Lossless Semi-Synchronous Replication. As I think the answer could benefit many people, I am answering it in a blog post. The answer brings us to the internals of transaction committing, of semi-synchronous replication, of MySQL (server) crash recovery, and of storage engine (InnoDB) crash recovery. I am also debunking some misconceptions that I have often seen and heard repeated by many.</description></item></channel></rss>
