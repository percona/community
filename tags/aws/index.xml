Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Amazon EKS is certified Kubernetes-conformant, so existing applications that run on upstream Kubernetes are compatible with Amazon EKS.
Getting started guides available in the AWS documentation explain two different procedures for creating an EKS cluster.</description></item><item><title>Serverless Databases: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly – Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/10/08/serverless-databases-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 20:58:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/10/08/serverless-databases-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Wed 21 Oct • New York 4:30 a.m. • London 9:30 a.m • New Delhi 2:00 p.m. • Singapore 4:30 p.m.
Abstract Starting with AWS, the major cloud providers offer different options to run a MySQL or a MySQL-compatible database on the cloud. A new approach is to rely on so-called serverless (relational) databases like Aurora Serverless that offer both traditional TCP connections and HTTP API access.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live ONLINE Opening Keynote: State of Open Source Databases by Peter Zaitsev</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/15/percona-live-online-opening-keynote-state-of-open-source-databases-by-peter-zaitsev/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:44:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/15/percona-live-online-opening-keynote-state-of-open-source-databases-by-peter-zaitsev/</guid><description>Peter Zaitsev is CEO and co-founder of Percona. He opened Percona Live ONLINE with a keynote which took a look at the historical foundations of open source software and how they have shaped the field today.
The history of open source software In the early days of computing, software and hardware were bundled together. While the term open source wasn&amp;rsquo;t coined, software was open by default. According to Peter: &amp;ldquo;One of the big reasons for that was copyrights on software was not a thing, because the software was not really a thing before that.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live ONLINE: Anti-cheating tools for massive multiplayer games using Amazon Aurora and Amazon ML services</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/11/percona-live-online-anti-cheating-tools-for-massive-multiplayer-games-using-amazon-aurora-and-amazon-ml-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:21:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/11/percona-live-online-anti-cheating-tools-for-massive-multiplayer-games-using-amazon-aurora-and-amazon-ml-services/</guid><description>Would you play a multiplayer game if you discovered other people are cheating? According to a survey by Irdeto, 60% of online games were negatively impacted by cheaters, and 77% of players said they would stop playing a multiplayer game if they think opponents are cheating. Player churn grows as cheating grows.
Stopping this is therefore essential if you want to build and develop your community, which is essential to success for today’s gaming companies.</description></item><item><title>Anti-Cheating Tool for Massive Multiplayer Games Using Amazon Aurora and Amazon ML Services – Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/05/13/anti-cheating-tool-for-massive-multiplayer-games-using-amazon-aurora-and-amazon-ml-services-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 16:06:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/05/13/anti-cheating-tool-for-massive-multiplayer-games-using-amazon-aurora-and-amazon-ml-services-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Tue 19 May • New York 4 p.m. • London 9 p.m. • New Delhi 1:30 a.m. (Wed) Level: Intermediate
Abstract Multiplayer video games are among the most lucrative online services. The overall games industry worldwide generated an estimated $174B in 2019, according to IDC. With this popularity, cheating becomes a common trend. Cheating in multiplayer games negatively impacts the game experience for players who play by the rules, and it becomes a revenue issue for game developers and publishers.</description></item><item><title>A First Look at Amazon RDS Proxy</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/01/07/a-first-look-at-amazon-rds-proxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 11:45:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/01/07/a-first-look-at-amazon-rds-proxy/</guid><description>At re:Invent in Las Vegas in December 2019, AWS announced the public preview of RDS Proxy, a fully managed database proxy that sits between your application and RDS. The new service offers to &amp;ldquo;share established database connections, improving database efficiency and application scalability&amp;rdquo;.
But one of the benefits that caught my eye is the ability to reduce the downtime in case of an instance failure and a failover. As for the announcement:</description></item><item><title>How to Automate Minor Version Upgrades for MySQL on RDS</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/07/10/automate-minor-version-upgrades-mysql-rds/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 12:19:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/07/10/automate-minor-version-upgrades-mysql-rds/</guid><description>Amazon RDS for MySQL offers the option to automate minor version upgrades using the minor version upgrade policy, a property that lets you decide if Amazon is allowed to perform the upgrades on your behalf. Usually the goal is not to upgrade automatically every RDS instance but to keep up to date automatically non-production deployments. This helps you address engine issues as soon as possible and improve the automation of the deployment process.</description></item><item><title>Enabling KMS encryption for a running Amazon RDS instance</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/06/08/enabling-kms-encryption-running-amazon-rds-instance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:40:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/06/08/enabling-kms-encryption-running-amazon-rds-instance/</guid><description>Since summer 2017, Amazon RDS supports encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for db.t2.small and db.t2.medium database instances, making the feature now available to virtually every instance class and type.
Unless you are running Previous Generation DB Instances or you can only afford to run a db.t2.micro, every other instance class now supports native encryption at rest using KMS. As for the Amazon documentation:
Encryption on smaller T2 database instances is useful for development and test use cases, where you want the environment to have identical security characteristics as the planned production environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
