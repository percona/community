Want to learn PostgreSQL? What if you could learn PostgreSQL without having to install the database, load data, find sample data, and it was free? PGExamples.com is what you are looking for.
First, let me state that I have no connection to the website or its author. I discovered PgExercises.com by accident and was impressed by its quality and completeness. I am so impressed that I am exploring a video series on it.</description></item><item><title>How To Generate Test Data for Your Database With SQL</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/30/how-to-generate-test-data-for-your-database-with-sql/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/30/how-to-generate-test-data-for-your-database-with-sql/</guid><description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed several posts on the Percona Community blog about test data generation. This is a great trend, as such data enables us to test applications more easily and efficiently and detect problems before they appear in production. One article was devoted to the Pagila standard DB schema and another to generating test data with Python. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to continue this tradition and write an article about generating data using SQL.</description></item><item><title>Rivers vs Axis</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/07/18/rivers-vs-axis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/07/18/rivers-vs-axis/</guid><description>It’s hard to find at least two people who would format the same SQL query in the same way. Everyone has their own style and their own arguments. And everyone is absolutely sure that this is the only right way.
That was to be expected, because of the declarative nature of SQL. In imperative program languages, we define and control the order of statements execution, and it affects how we format our code.</description></item><item><title>Database as Code.

But how about Database as Code? If you have just dropped your DB migrations scripts to your pipeline, then it’s great, but that’s where “Database as Code” is just getting started. In this post, I will share my view on “Database as Code” mantra.
Everything as Code And we will start with &amp;ldquo;Everything as Code&amp;rdquo; things. &amp;ldquo;Everything as Code&amp;rdquo; is a philosophy, where any IT area might be represented as a plain code.</description></item><item><title>IIoT platform databases - How Mail.ru Cloud Solutions deals with petabytes of data coming from a multitude of devices</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/07/24/iiot-platform-databases-how-mail-ru-cloud-solutions-deals-with-petabytes-of-data-coming-from-a-multitude-of-devices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 14:11:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/07/24/iiot-platform-databases-how-mail-ru-cloud-solutions-deals-with-petabytes-of-data-coming-from-a-multitude-of-devices/</guid><description>Hello, my name is Andrey Sergeyev and I work as a Head of IoT Solution Development at Mail.ru Cloud Solutions.

Especially when the task is to build an IoT platform that would be capable of processing millions of events from various sensors in near real-time.
Our product Mail.ru IoT Platform started as a Tarantool-based prototype. I’m going to tell you about our journey, the problems we faced and the solutions we found.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live ONLINE: Anti-cheating tools for massive multiplayer games using Amazon Aurora and Amazon ML services</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/11/percona-live-online-anti-cheating-tools-for-massive-multiplayer-games-using-amazon-aurora-and-amazon-ml-services/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:21:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/11/percona-live-online-anti-cheating-tools-for-massive-multiplayer-games-using-amazon-aurora-and-amazon-ml-services/</guid><description>Would you play a multiplayer game if you discovered other people are cheating? According to a survey by Irdeto, 60% of online games were negatively impacted by cheaters, and 77% of players said they would stop playing a multiplayer game if they think opponents are cheating. Player churn grows as cheating grows.
Stopping this is therefore essential if you want to build and develop your community, which is essential to success for today’s gaming companies.</description></item></channel></rss>
