However, like everyone else around the world, all our plans are on hold due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
Perhaps you, like many others, are organizing online events, such as virtual meetups on Meetup.com. We can help you by making Percona’s team of experienced and well-known speakers available for your event.</description></item></channel></rss>
