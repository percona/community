On September 7th, we landed in Istanbul, the vibrant cultural and economic hub of Türkiye, for a day of learning, networking, and meaningful connections.
The day began with clear skies and high energy as we gathered early on Istanbul&amp;rsquo;s Asian side, at a co-working space.
The event kicked off at 9:30 with coffee, networking, and a chance to register, followed by the opening talk by Percona’s founder, Peter Zaitsev.</description></item></channel></rss>
