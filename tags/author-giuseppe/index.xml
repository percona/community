Abstract DBdeployer, an open source tool that allows easy deployment of many MySQL/Percona servers in the same host, has passed two years of development. Its latest additions have aimed at improving ease of use for both beginners and experts. This talk will show how to start with dbdeployer with an empty box, and quickly populate it with recent and less recent server versions, all at the command line.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: Test Like a Boss</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/09/25/percona-live-europe-presents-test-like-a-boss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 06:31:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/09/25/percona-live-europe-presents-test-like-a-boss/</guid><description>My first talk is a tutorial Testing like a boss: Deploy and Test Complex Topologies With a Single Command, scheduled at Percona Live Europe in Amsterdam on September 30th at 13:30.
My second talk is Amazing sandboxes with dbdeployer scheduled on October 1st at 11:00. It is the same topic as the tutorial, but covers a narrow set of features, all in the *amazing* category.
The tutorial introduces a challenging topic, because when people hear testing, they imagine a troop of monkeys fiddling with a keyboard and a mouse, endlessly repeating a boring task.</description></item></channel></rss>
