A secure system or a database means it is secured by all means. The main pillars of security are A(Authentication), A (Authorization), and A (Accounting). PostgreSQL provides different levels of security. Sometimes it takes effort to learn how to use different types of authentication, what it is and authorization, and how to do auditing and accounting.</description></item><item><title>International Day of Computer Security 2022</title><link>https://percona.community/events/international-day-of-computer-security-2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/international-day-of-computer-security-2022/</guid><description>On November 30th, Percona&amp;rsquo;s Technical Evangelists Edith Puclla and Mario GarcÃ­a participated in the International Day of Computer Security.
