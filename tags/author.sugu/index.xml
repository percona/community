Running stateless applications is now considered a solved problem. However, it&amp;rsquo;s currently not practical to put databases like MySQL in containers, give them to Kubernetes, and expect it to manage their life cycles.

Vitess addresses this need by providing all the necessary orchestration and safety, and it has multiple years of mileage to show for it.</description></item></channel></rss>
