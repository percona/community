In our day to day development&amp;rsquo;s and user&amp;rsquo;s life we use tons of OSS (open source) software. Ppl develop that software together to have ability to use them in more standard and open way, so they spend less time negotiating on interfaces and tools (and that is not the main reason, one of the reasons for OSS).
As any sustainable process, OSS development also needs not only users but contributors to be able to move project forward as well as to sustain bugs, time and new tech trends.</description></item><item><title>How long do you keep the metrics in PMM?</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/11/poll-metrics-keep/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/11/poll-metrics-keep/</guid><description>Hello everyone! We are indeed excited to announce that the new release of VictoriaMetrics has many exciting features, one of them being downsampling.
Downsampling helps to reduce disk space usage and improves query performance in a big and long time series if applied independently per each time series. However, this feature works only with a large number of samples per series.
As we are keen on implementing downsampling in our future releases, we would like to understand how long you keep your metrics in PMM.</description></item><item><title>How to Publish a Blog Post</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/10/how-to-publish-blog-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/10/how-to-publish-blog-post/</guid><description>If you write technical content or just want to become an author, this blog is open to you!

We have talked how to install Percona&amp;rsquo;s various components, the different software that we have, specifically looking at our server software in Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB. We tackle how to install from a repository and what are the different install options that we have?

Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI (Open Container Initiative) Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be run as root or in rootless mode. More details here.
Check out also Kubernetes Podcast to learn more about podman and listen to it&amp;rsquo;s creators.
Why to replace? Especially in development I need simplest possible solution, I don&amp;rsquo;t need additional daemon running or allowing something to run with elevated privileges.</description></item><item><title>Percona Supports Community Events - Organize Yours With Us!</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/12/23/community-events-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/12/23/community-events-support/</guid><description>One of the things we love doing in Percona is participating in community events and inspiring people to stay connected in the changing world. We have experience in organizing community dinners, meetups, lectures at universities, booths, and even conferences both in-person and virtually. Percona speakers give talks on events all around the globe.
Have you ever thought about organizing a themed meeting for your local open source community? It may harbor many possibilities for you.</description></item><item><title>PMM development and testing with help of minikube</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/12/20/pmm-minikube-postgres/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/12/20/pmm-minikube-postgres/</guid><description>Why Some time ago I needed to test PG14 with the new pg_stat_monitor version that wasn&amp;rsquo;t released. I decided to log my journey so I would spend less effort next time to replicate it.
I do use podman and run PMM with its help but I also like to hack PMM DBaaS features and think that k8s and minikube are perfect and better scalable solutions for the different development environments and especially for the number of clusters and DBs.</description></item><item><title>Percona MeetUp for Percona Monitoring and Management PMM Dec 1st, 2021</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/percona-meetup-for-pmm-december-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/percona-meetup-for-pmm-december-2021/</guid><description>Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is designed and constantly updated with useful features for monitoring and optimizing your database performance.

Usually we discuss new features, talk about how to do something but even for me, a Percona developer, sometimes it is hard to know where and what to touch in PMM. There are many components, many abstractions, parts that send messages to remote APIs or agents, the PMM agent, the PMM API (pmm-managed), the command line client (pmm-admin) and all the external exporters.</description></item><item><title>Percona MeetUp for PMM Sept 2021</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/percona-meetup-for-pmm-september-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/percona-meetup-for-pmm-september-2021/</guid><description>The Community MeetUp for PMM was an extraordinary one-hour Live Broadcast MeetUp from the OSS Summit on last Sept 29th, to talk about open source databases, observability and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL with PMM.

According to the goal to involve open source contributors to contribute to PMM and Percona to contribute to open source. As the main focus, it was decided to start from the exporter.
For now PMM use the next exporters:
https://github.com/percona/node_exporter https://github.com/percona/mysqld_exporter https://github.com/percona/mongodb_exporter https://github.com/percona/postgres_exporter https://github.com/Percona-Lab/clickhouse_exporter https://github.com/percona/proxysql_exporter https://github.com/percona/rds_exporter https://github.com/percona/azure_metrics_exporter Groups We can split them into three groups.</description></item><item><title>Google Summer of Code Refactor PMM Framework Project with Percona</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/09/07/google-summer-of-code-refactor-pmm-framework-project-with-percona/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 11:08:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/09/07/google-summer-of-code-refactor-pmm-framework-project-with-percona/</guid><description>I am Meet Patel, 2nd year undergraduate at DAIICT, Gandhinagar, India; pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Information and Communication Technology with a minor in Computational Science.

This is something that Peter Zaitsev, co-founder and CEO of Percona, understands very well.
In the build-up to his hands-on presentation with the open source Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) platform, Peter spoke about how inducting a database in an organization is a constant tussle between the developers, the management and the DBAs.</description></item><item><title>Matt Yonkovit: It's a crazy world, and these trends are disrupting and breaking your database infrastructure</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/12/matt-yonkovit-its-a-crazy-world-and-these-trends-are-disrupting-and-breaking-your-database-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:30:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/12/matt-yonkovit-its-a-crazy-world-and-these-trends-are-disrupting-and-breaking-your-database-infrastructure/</guid><description>Matt Yonkovit, Chief Experience Officer at Percona, presented a session at this year&amp;rsquo;s Percona Live ONLINE, sharing initial insights from the Open Source Data Management Survey 2020.
