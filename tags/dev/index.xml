It is an invaluable addition to any DBA&amp;rsquo;s toolkit, but unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not really actively maintained these days, except for addressing critical issues, and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t kept pace with the evolving capabilities of modern terminals. With no viable alternatives except for InnotopGo, which is also no longer actively maintained and limited to MySQL 8 (while many still use 5.</description></item><item><title>How To Optimize the Structure of a Simple PHP Application as Your Project Grows</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/28/how-to-optimize-the-structure-of-a-simple-php-application-as-your-project-grows/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/28/how-to-optimize-the-structure-of-a-simple-php-application-as-your-project-grows/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the structure of our simple PHP application, folders, files, and functions and transform the project to grow it.
You and I have developed a small PHP application that makes an HTTP request to the GitHub API and stores the result in the database.
Step 1 - How to Develop a Simple Web Application Using Docker-compose, Nginx, PHP 8, and MongoDB 6. Step 2 - How to Make HTTP Requests to API in PHP App Using GitHub API Example and Write to Percona Server for MongoDB.</description></item><item><title>How To Generate Test Data for Your Database Project With Python</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/09/how-to-generate-test-data-for-your-database-project-with-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/09/how-to-generate-test-data-for-your-database-project-with-python/</guid><description>If you need test data for the database of your project, you can get a dataset from Kaggle or use a data generator. In the first case, if you need to process the data before inserting it into the database, you can use Pandas, a widely used Python library for data analysis. This library supports different formats, including CSV and JSON, and it also provides a method for inserting data into a SQL database.</description></item><item><title>Minimize MySQL Deadlocks with 3 Steps</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/24/minimize-mysql-deadlocks-3-steps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 10:49:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/24/minimize-mysql-deadlocks-3-steps/</guid><description>MySQL has locking capabilities, for example table and row level locking, and such locks are needed to control data integrity in multi-user concurrency. Deadlocks—where two or more transactions are waiting for one another to give up locks before the transactions can proceed successfully—are an unwanted situation. It is a classic problem for all databases including MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle etc. By default, MySQL detects the deadlock condition and to break the deadlock it rolls back one of the transactions.</description></item></channel></rss>
