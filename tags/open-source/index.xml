Now we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do it with a Python project, using SQLAlchemy and Docker Compose, which further automates this example. You can run this example using a single command: docker-compose up
Before getting down to work, we will review some important concepts:</description></item><item><title>Some Notable Bugfixes in MySQL 8.0.32</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/15/some-notable-bugfixes-in-mysql-8.0.32/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/15/some-notable-bugfixes-in-mysql-8.0.32/</guid><description>MySQL 8.0.32 came out recently and had some important bugfixes contributed by Perconians. Here is a brief overview of the work done.
Inconsistent data and GTIDs with mysqldump Marcelo Altmann (Senior Software Engineer) fixed the bug when data and GTIDs backed up by mysqldump were inconsistent. It happened when the options &amp;ndash;single-transaction and &amp;ndash;set-gtid-purged=ON were both used because GTIDs on the server could have already increased between the start of the transaction by mysqldump and the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED.</description></item><item><title>Using the JSON data type with MySQL 8</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/13/using-the-json-data-type-with-mysql-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/13/using-the-json-data-type-with-mysql-8/</guid><description>If you are a mobile app, frontend, backend, or game developer, you use data types such as string, numeric, or DateTime. You also know that since the advent of non-relational databases (NoSQL) such as MongoDB, which, by not being tied to a traditional SQL schema, do reading and writing on databases much faster. But MySQL showed that storing the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data type could also improve the speed of reading and writing relational databases.</description></item><item><title>Monitor your databases with Open Source tools like PMM</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/06/monitor-your-databases-with-open-source-tools-like-pmm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/06/monitor-your-databases-with-open-source-tools-like-pmm/</guid><description>In this post, we will cover the value of database monitoring and how we can use Open Source tools like PMM Percona Monitoring and Management to monitor and manage databases effectively.
Why should I care about database monitoring? Once you have passed the installation and configuration of your databases and it is well underway, you have to start monitoring it, and not only the database but the elements related to it.</description></item><item><title>What is Open Source and why should you care</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-open-source-and-why-should-you-care/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-open-source-and-why-should-you-care/</guid><description>The term Open Source Software reminds me of Abraham Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s widely accepted definition of Democracy. Lincoln said, &amp;ldquo;Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, and for the people&amp;rdquo;. Similarly, Open Source is software of the community, by the community, and for the community.
Formally, Open Source refers to projects or programs whose source code can be modified, shared, and/or commercialized by the public/community at will. A license that is attached to an Open Source project determines the extent to which the project can be consumed, modified, or utilized.</description></item><item><title>TiSpark: More Data Insights, No More ETL</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/06/18/tispark-data-insights-no-etl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2018 13:41:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/06/18/tispark-data-insights-no-etl/</guid><description>When we released TiDB 2.0 in April, part of that announcement also included the release of TiSpark 1.0&amp;ndash;an integral part of the TiDB platform that makes complex analytics on “fresh” transactional data possible. Since then, many people in the TiDB community have been asking for more information about TiSpark. In this post, I will explain the motivation, inner workings, and future roadmap of this project.
Motivation The motivation behind building TiSpark was to enable real-time analytics on TiDB without the delay and challenges of ETL.</description></item></channel></rss>
