Then, Tarantool is an open-source product with its source code in open access, and anyone can develop and distribute Tarantool-based software freely.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you about an attempt to write my own data structure for the search (the Z-order curve) and build it into the Tarantool ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>IIoT platform databases - How Mail.ru Cloud Solutions deals with petabytes of data coming from a multitude of devices</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/07/24/iiot-platform-databases-how-mail-ru-cloud-solutions-deals-with-petabytes-of-data-coming-from-a-multitude-of-devices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 14:11:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/07/24/iiot-platform-databases-how-mail-ru-cloud-solutions-deals-with-petabytes-of-data-coming-from-a-multitude-of-devices/</guid><description>Hello, my name is Andrey Sergeyev and I work as a Head of IoT Solution Development at Mail.ru Cloud Solutions.

Especially when the task is to build an IoT platform that would be capable of processing millions of events from various sensors in near real-time.
Our product Mail.ru IoT Platform started as a Tarantool-based prototype. I’m going to tell you about our journey, the problems we faced and the solutions we found.</description></item><item><title>Making a Tarantool-Based Investment Business Core for Alfa-Bank</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/19/making-a-tarantool-based-investment-business-core-for-alfa-bank/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:23:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/19/making-a-tarantool-based-investment-business-core-for-alfa-bank/</guid><description>A still from &amp;ldquo;Our Secret Universe: The Hidden Life of the Cell&amp;rdquo;

In this article, I’m going to tell you about the internals of Lua tables and special considerations for their use. Lua is my primary professional programming language, and if one wants to write good code, one needs at least to peek behind the curtain. If you are curious, follow me.
Lua has several implementations and several versions.</description></item><item><title>Deploying Tarantool Cartridge Applications with Zero Effort (Part 2)</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/04/01/deploying-tarantool-cartridge-applications-with-zero-effort-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 11:04:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/04/01/deploying-tarantool-cartridge-applications-with-zero-effort-part-2/</guid><description>We have recently talked about how to deploy a Tarantool Cartridge application.
