In our day to day development&amp;rsquo;s and user&amp;rsquo;s life we use tons of OSS (open source) software. Ppl develop that software together to have ability to use them in more standard and open way, so they spend less time negotiating on interfaces and tools (and that is not the main reason, one of the reasons for OSS).
As any sustainable process, OSS development also needs not only users but contributors to be able to move project forward as well as to sustain bugs, time and new tech trends.</description></item><item><title> Percona Community MeetUp - Installation and Configuration of PostgreSQL Operator - March, 2nd</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/2022-03-02-percona-meetup-postgresql-operator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/2022-03-02-percona-meetup-postgresql-operator/</guid><description>Learn more about Installation and Configuration of PostgreSQL Operator in this video from our meetup of Wednesday, March, 2nd at 11 am EST.
