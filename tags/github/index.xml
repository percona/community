Lincoln said, &amp;ldquo;Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, and for the people&amp;rdquo;. Similarly, Open Source is software of the community, by the community, and for the community.
Formally, Open Source refers to projects or programs whose source code can be modified, shared, and/or commercialized by the public/community at will. A license that is attached to an Open Source project determines the extent to which the project can be consumed, modified, or utilized.</description></item><item><title>Embracing the Stream</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/12/10/embracing-the-stream/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 10:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/12/10/embracing-the-stream/</guid><description>So this happened: CentOS Project shifts focus to CentOS Stream
The future of the CentOS Project is CentOS Stream, and over the next year we’ll be shifting focus from CentOS Linux, the rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), to CentOS Stream, which tracks just ahead of a current RHEL release.

The workloads are mostly reads, so we need to efficiently scale that. The MySQL® asynchronous replication model fits the bill very well, allowing us to scale horizontally from one server—with the obvious availability pitfalls—to tens of nodes. The next release of the stack is going to be open-sourced.</description></item></channel></rss>
