Why should I care about database monitoring? Once you have passed the installation and configuration of your databases and it is well underway, you have to start monitoring it, and not only the database but the elements related to it.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Databases on Containers with Percona Server for MySQL</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/23/exploring-databases-on-containers-with-mysql/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/23/exploring-databases-on-containers-with-mysql/</guid><description>In this blog, we will explore databases on containers. We will use Docker as a container engine tool and Percona Server for MySQL as a database administration tool. Both are open source tools.
MySQL is a relational database management system that stores data on disk. Percona Server for MySQL is a fork of MYSQL, providing much more advanced features. To run it correctly, we need to know volumes because we want to “persist” the data, the most important thing in databases.</description></item><item><title>What is Open Source and why should you care</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-open-source-and-why-should-you-care/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-open-source-and-why-should-you-care/</guid><description>The term Open Source Software reminds me of Abraham Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s widely accepted definition of Democracy. Lincoln said, &amp;ldquo;Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, and for the people&amp;rdquo;. Similarly, Open Source is software of the community, by the community, and for the community.
Formally, Open Source refers to projects or programs whose source code can be modified, shared, and/or commercialized by the public/community at will. A license that is attached to an Open Source project determines the extent to which the project can be consumed, modified, or utilized.</description></item><item><title>Recap Monthly Percona Developer Meetup Hacktoberfest</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/05/recap-monthly-percona-developer-meetup-hacktoberfest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/05/recap-monthly-percona-developer-meetup-hacktoberfest/</guid><description>The Monthly Percona Developer Meetup is an opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes view of different projects in Percona and directly interact with the experts to exchange ideas, ask questions, etc.
From now on, Monthly Percona Developer Meetups will take place monthly to have open discussions and in-person (online) communication. You can join our Developer Meetup via Restream, the Percona YouTube channel, and LinkedIn events.
The topic of the first Monthly Percona Developer Meetup was Hacktoberfest.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Cloud Migrations With Databases on Kubernetes</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-sergey-pronin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-sergey-pronin/</guid><description> This session was presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022. Check out the full schedule here.
In this talk you will learn how Kubernetes and Percona Operators can help you to avoid vendor lock-in when you run your databases in containers with Percona Operators.

We can&amp;rsquo;t stop lag, but we can help to reduce it. Many times the Seconds_Behind_Source can be very deciving, I have seen it go from 1 hour behind to 0 lag in the blink of an eye. There are many factors that can add to replica lag. Some of these are:
Network IO Disk IO Database Workload Database settings In this blog we will look a few database settings to help reduce lag.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Bullseye Percona Server 64bit</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/04/05/percona-server-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/04/05/percona-server-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>I love the Raspberry Pi, and I love Percona server. The combination of the two can provide a nice home database. I have been running a Percona Server database since 2019 to hold all the weather information, that I collect from several of my Weather Stations.
I did a my first blog post on installing Percona Server 5.7 on the Raspberry Pi 3+.

Oracle/MySQL define a GTID as "A global transaction identifier (GTID) is a unique identifier created and associated with each transaction committed on the server of origin (the source). This identifier is unique not only to the server on which it originated, but is unique across all servers in a given replication topology." An errant transaction can make promotion of a replica to primary very difficult.</description></item><item><title>The lost art of Database Server Initialization.</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/09/06/lost-art-of-database-server-initialization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/09/06/lost-art-of-database-server-initialization/</guid><description>With all the DBaaS, IaaS and PaaS environments, sometimes I think the Art of MySQL initialization is becoming a lost art. Many times we just delete the MySQL Server and order a new one.
Just recently I was talking with a colleague, and this subject came up. We both thought about it and decided we have become spoiled by automation. We were both rusty on this process. This gave me the idea for this post.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live ONLINE Opening Keynote: State of Open Source Databases by Peter Zaitsev</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/15/percona-live-online-opening-keynote-state-of-open-source-databases-by-peter-zaitsev/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:44:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/06/15/percona-live-online-opening-keynote-state-of-open-source-databases-by-peter-zaitsev/</guid><description>Peter Zaitsev is CEO and co-founder of Percona. He opened Percona Live ONLINE with a keynote which took a look at the historical foundations of open source software and how they have shaped the field today.
The history of open source software In the early days of computing, software and hardware were bundled together. While the term open source wasn&amp;rsquo;t coined, software was open by default. According to Peter: &amp;ldquo;One of the big reasons for that was copyrights on software was not a thing, because the software was not really a thing before that.</description></item></channel></rss>
