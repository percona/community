The main feature of this release is MySQL 8.4 support.
In this blog, I will explain what has been changed. A full list of improvements and bug fixes can be found in the release notes.
TLDR;
Replication statements in 8.4 are fully supported by the Percona Toolkit pt-slave-delay has been deprecated. pt-slave-find has been renamed to pt-replica-find. The old name has been deprecated but exists in the repository as an alias of the pt-replica-find.</description></item><item><title>Percona Bug Report: October 2024</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2024/11/25/percona-bug-report-october-2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2024/11/25/percona-bug-report-october-2024/</guid><description>At Percona, we operate on the premise that full transparency makes a product better.

Percona Everest is the first open source cloud-native platform for provisioning and managing PostgreSQL, MongoDB and MySQL database clusters.
I want to tell you how to install it so you can try it out.
RC builds aren&amp;rsquo;t meant for the general public; we don&amp;rsquo;t support upgrading from RC to stable versions. This means that this is only for testing and familiarizing yourself with the features.</description></item><item><title>Take a Clone it will last longer</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2024/06/02/take-a-clone-it-will-last-longer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2024/06/02/take-a-clone-it-will-last-longer/</guid><description>So cloning is a great subject.

What is MySQL Replicaion:
The MySQL clone plugin can be used to replicate data from a MySQL server to another MySQL server, and it supports replication. The cloning process creates a physical snapshot of the data, including tables, schemas, tablespaces, and data dictionary metadata.</description></item><item><title>Release Roundup May 15, 2024</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2024/05/15/release-roundup-may-15-2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2024/05/15/release-roundup-may-15-2024/</guid><description>Percona software releases and updates April 30 - May 15, 2024.

One way to achieve data isolation for each client is to create a separate MySQL database for each tenant.
Some advantages of this approach are:
It allows for easy backup and restore of individual tenant data. It simplifies the database administration and maintenance tasks, as each database can be managed independently.</description></item><item><title>Percona Bug Report: November 2023</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/12/19/percona-bug-report-november-2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/12/19/percona-bug-report-november-2023/</guid><description>At Percona, we operate on the premise that full transparency makes a product better.

ProxySQL provides a firewall which, in my case, is not complete enough to properly manage users and secure their access. Indeed, this firewall does not accept subnets and keeps unauthorized connections in ProxySQL. We cannot then be sure of not suffering a DDOS attack on our ProxySQL instance. In this article, I will explain how I managed to overcome this problem.</description></item><item><title>Some Notable Bugfixes in MySQL 8.0.32</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/15/some-notable-bugfixes-in-mysql-8.0.32/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/15/some-notable-bugfixes-in-mysql-8.0.32/</guid><description>MySQL 8.0.32 came out recently and had some important bugfixes contributed by Perconians. Here is a brief overview of the work done.
Inconsistent data and GTIDs with mysqldump Marcelo Altmann (Senior Software Engineer) fixed the bug when data and GTIDs backed up by mysqldump were inconsistent. It happened when the options &amp;ndash;single-transaction and &amp;ndash;set-gtid-purged=ON were both used because GTIDs on the server could have already increased between the start of the transaction by mysqldump and the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED.</description></item><item><title>Using the JSON data type with MySQL 8</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/13/using-the-json-data-type-with-mysql-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/13/using-the-json-data-type-with-mysql-8/</guid><description>If you are a mobile app, frontend, backend, or game developer, you use data types such as string, numeric, or DateTime. You also know that since the advent of non-relational databases (NoSQL) such as MongoDB, which, by not being tied to a traditional SQL schema, do reading and writing on databases much faster. But MySQL showed that storing the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data type could also improve the speed of reading and writing relational databases.</description></item><item><title>Backups for MySQL With mysqldump</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/10/backups-for-mysql-with-mysqldump/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/03/10/backups-for-mysql-with-mysqldump/</guid><description>Basic Usage mysqldump is a client utility that can be used for doing logical backups. It will generate the necessary SQL statements to reproduce the original database.
Backup by Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0 Pix4free The following statements are some common uses of mysqldump:
mysqldump -u username -p database_name [table_name] &amp;gt; dump.sql mysqldump -u username -p --databases db1_name db2_name &amp;gt; dump.sql mysqldump -u username -p --all-databases &amp;gt; dump.sql The first example is for backing up a single database.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Databases on Containers with Percona Server for MySQL</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/23/exploring-databases-on-containers-with-mysql/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/02/23/exploring-databases-on-containers-with-mysql/</guid><description>In this blog, we will explore databases on containers. We will use Docker as a container engine tool and Percona Server for MySQL as a database administration tool. Both are open source tools.
MySQL is a relational database management system that stores data on disk. Percona Server for MySQL is a fork of MYSQL, providing much more advanced features. To run it correctly, we need to know volumes because we want to “persist” the data, the most important thing in databases.</description></item><item><title>Deploying MySQL Group Replication With Terraform</title><link>https://percona.community/labs/posts/2023-02-15-deploying-mysql-group-replication-terraform/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/labs/posts/2023-02-15-deploying-mysql-group-replication-terraform/</guid><description>Previously, I wrote about our Terraform provider to deploy Percona Server for MySQL (Percona Server for MySQL: Automatic Cloud Deployment With Terraform) and Percona Monitoring and Management (Deploying Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) With Terraform).

In a grander scheme of things, I will need to define what performance data from a query I am actually interested in. I will also need to find a way to attribute the query (as seen on the server) to a point in the codebase of the client, which is not always easy when an ORM or other SQL generator is being used.</description></item><item><title>How to Benchmark Your MySQL Database - Percona Community MySQL Live Stream &amp; Chat - Oct 14th</title><link>https://percona.community/events/streams-mysql/2022-10-28-how-to-benchmark-your-mysql-database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/streams-mysql/2022-10-28-how-to-benchmark-your-mysql-database/</guid><description>Percona Community Live Stream for MySQL will focus on benchmarking a MySQL database.

A common request that we get from our clients is to make MySQL highly available or to enhance existing architecture. We have standardized our approach by combining a proxy layer, for traffic redirection, a topology management tool, for master failover/switchover, and some additional tools to glue together both layers.

Regardless of development frameworks, despite linters, besides countless sessions with the DBA, slow queries always end up making it to production. Proactive and reactive slow query tuning is still critical to ensure poorly written queries aren&amp;rsquo;t undermining server performance and wasting valuable compute resources. Cloud-based database managed services are not the exception: slow query root cause analysis requires human intervention.</description></item><item><title>Optimization Techniques in MySQL</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-yunus-shaikh/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-yunus-shaikh/</guid><description> This session was presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

Oracle/MySQL define a GTID as "A global transaction identifier (GTID) is a unique identifier created and associated with each transaction committed on the server of origin (the source). This identifier is unique not only to the server on which it originated, but is unique across all servers in a given replication topology." An errant transaction can make promotion of a replica to primary very difficult.</description></item><item><title> MeetUp for MySQL - Database Backup and Xtrabackup - Nov 3rd 2021</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/percona-meetup-for-mysql-november-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/percona-meetup-for-mysql-november-2021/</guid><description>Full recording of the Percona MeetUp for MySQL of Nov 3rd 2021.

Many times we just delete the MySQL Server and order a new one.
Just recently I was talking with a colleague, and this subject came up. We both thought about it and decided we have become spoiled by automation. We were both rusty on this process. This gave me the idea for this post.</description></item><item><title>Lets be inSync!</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/07/22/lets-be-insync/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/07/22/lets-be-insync/</guid><description>Percona Toolkit + pt-table-checksum + pt-table-sync = Faster Replica Recovery Asynchronous replication with MySQL is a tried and true technology. Add the use of GTID’s and you have a very stable solution.
The fundamental issue with async replication is that writes sent to the Replica are not guaranteed to be written. I have only seen a handful of times when writes did not get applied to the replica. Most of the time this happens is due to network packet drops or a replica crashes before new data is committed.</description></item><item><title>Create your own Exporter in Go!</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/07/21/create-your-own-exporter-in-go/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/07/21/create-your-own-exporter-in-go/</guid><description>Overview Hi, it’s too hot summer in Korea.

Following MySQL InnoDB Cluster as our first, fully integrated MySQL High Availability solution based on Group Replication, MySQL Shell 8.0.19 includes MySQL InnoDB ReplicaSet which delivers another complete solution, this time based on MySQL Replication.
The basic idea for InnoDB ReplicaSet is to do the same for classic MySQL Replication as InnoDB Cluster did for Group Replication. We take a strong technology that is very powerful but can be complex, and provide an easy-to-use AdminAPI for it in the MySQL Shell.</description></item><item><title>DBdeployer in Action - Optimised MySQL Sandboxes</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/9/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/9/</guid><description>Giuseppe Maxia and Frédéric Descamps - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021

JSON or JavaScript Object Notation has become the data interchange format of choice. Most relational databases have added a JSON data type (Oracle, Postgresql, MySQL) or some accommodation for JSON data (SQL Server, MariaDB). But the free form nature of JSON is problematic for relational databases resulting in compromises in speed, handling of key-value pairs, and general lack of the ability to validate data.</description></item><item><title>Successfully Run Your MySQL NDB Cluster in Kubernetes</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/7/</guid><description>Tiago Alves - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021

Since 2020 the MySQL development team is offering a fully managed database service of the MySQL Enterprise Edition. Traditionally MySQL InnoDB is designed for online transaction processing (OLTP) load. MySQL can cover online analytics processing (OLAP) load, but it is often rather slow and tricky. Beginning of December 2020, the MySQL team started a second MySQL Cloud offering called MySQL HeatWave for Real-time Analytics which is based on a new in-memory analytic accelerator which has been designed for extreme performance and cloud scale.</description></item><item><title>Insights Into the New Oracle MySQL Database Service</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/2/</guid><description>Carsten Thalheimer - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021
Oracle MySQL Database Cloud Service 2021 - Where we are today&amp;hellip;
Early 2020 Oracle introduced the MySQL Database Service (MDS) built on Oracle Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure and MySQL 8. It is 100% developed, managed, and supported by the Oracle MySQL team. The service is available as a fully-managed service in all commercial regions of the Oracle Cloud.</description></item><item><title>MySQL Server Component Manifest Files</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mysql-room/1/</guid><description>Georgi Kodinov - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021
MySQL configuration has traditionally been done via system variables with values coming from either command line, config files or SET commands. This can be a security issue since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support a trust model rooted in some well known trusted state that cannot be modified by less trusted actors.
This is what the manifest le security model is aiming at solving.</description></item><item><title>Automating MariaDB Deployments With Ansible</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/6/</guid><description>Federico Razzoli - Vettabase - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
This demo shows how to deploy MariaDB with Ansible. We&amp;rsquo;ll look into the Ansible playbook and the Ansible commands to use to install MariaDB, upgrade MariaDB, and modify MariaDB configuration on any number of servers. The Playbook we&amp;rsquo;ll use is a realistic production installation: it includes scheduled backups and a PMM agent to monitor the server performance. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how using Ansible saves long work hours, makes operations virtually error-free, and provides a complete documentation of servers configuration.</description></item><item><title>MariaDB ColumnStore – A Columnar Storage Engine, First Class Citizen in MariaDB</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/5/</guid><description>Vicențiu Ciorbaru - MariaDB Foundation - MariaDB ColumnStore – A Columnar Storage Engine, First Class Citizen in MariaDB - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
MariaDB has had ColumnStore (a columnar storage engine) available for a while now. The problem was that ColumnStore (formerly known as InniDB) was coded in such a way that required a custom version of MariaDB to function. The installation was also non-trivial, with quite a set of dependencies needed.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Work and Leadership in the Time of Pandemics</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/4/</guid><description>Anna Widenius - MariaDB Foundation - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
Virtual work and leadership in the time of pandemics MariaDB Foundation has been a virtual organization long before the pandemic struck. That gave us a head start in finding ways to adapt team leadership and management to the new times. Team leadership and management are different in a virtual organization, and in this session, we will talk about best practices within development teams.</description></item><item><title>JSON Additions in MariaDB - Featuring JSON_TABLE</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/3/</guid><description>Vicențiu Ciorbaru - MariaDB Foundation - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
MariaDB has had JSON support for a while now. Released initially in 10.2, MariaDB tries to follow the SQL standard as close as possible. One of the new additions coming to MariaDB 10.6 is support for JSON_TABLE. In this talk we will go through the details of this new feature, as well use cases and interactions with JSON path.</description></item><item><title>Collaboration in Open Source: A Q&amp;A on Github, Jira, Zulip and Knowledgebase</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/2/</guid><description>Kaj Arnö, Ian Gilfillan, Robert Bindar, Vicențiu Ciorbaru, Anna Widenius - MariaDB Foundation - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room
This is an extended, interactive panel / Q&amp;amp;A version of the 20 min talk on Collaboration in Open Source. Whereas the 20 min talk sets expectations, this session in the MariaDB Community Room goes in depth and solicits input from the audience. How can MariaDB Foundation improve its level of interactivity and collaboration with its developer community?</description></item><item><title>MariaDB 10.6 - What's New?</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-live/mariadb-room/1/</guid><description>Vicențiu Ciorbaru - MariaDB Foundation - MariaDB Community Track - Percona Live 2021
MariaDB&amp;rsquo;s 10.6 is coming with a lot of improvements, specifically centered around performance. Although the contents of this talk will depend on exactly what makes it into MariaDB 10.6 GA, the following topics will be covered.
Atomic DDL in MariaDB Optimizer changes InnoDB changes Oracle compatibility changes and parser changes</description></item><item><title>Not JOINing on PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/12/01/not-joining-on-performance_schema/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 19:22:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/12/01/not-joining-on-performance_schema/</guid><description>The tables in PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA (P_S) are not actually tables. You should not think of them as tables, even if your SQL works on them. You should not JOIN them, and you should not GROUP or ORDER BY them.
Unlocked memory buffers without indexes The stuff in P_S has been created with “keep the impact on production small” in mind. That is, from a users point of view, you can think of them as unlocked memory buffers - the values in there change as you look at them, and there are precisely zero stability guarantees.</description></item><item><title>On the Observability of Outliers</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/11/23/on-the-observability-of-outliers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:41:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/11/23/on-the-observability-of-outliers/</guid><description>At work, I am in an ongoing discussion with a number of people on the Observability of Outliers. It started with the age-old question “How do I find slow queries in my application?” aka “What would I want from tooling to get that data and where should that tooling sit?”

Abstract MySQL&amp;rsquo;s sweet spot is known to be online transaction processing (OLTP), and it can support a very high load of short transactions. Many users will also want to run analytical queries (OLAP) on their MySQL data. Often they achieve this by exporting their data to another database system that is tailored for analytical queries.</description></item><item><title>Serverless Databases: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly – Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/10/08/serverless-databases-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 20:58:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/10/08/serverless-databases-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Wed 21 Oct • New York 4:30 a.m. • London 9:30 a.m • New Delhi 2:00 p.m. • Singapore 4:30 p.m.

Abstract Kunlun Distributed Database Cluster is a distributed DBMS that aims to combine the best of both MySQL and PostgreSQL for a highly performant, highly available, highly scalable and fault-tolerant, easy to use and manage database system that requires minimal human maintenance. It enables users to define table sharding rules so that it automatically distributes tables properly to available storage shards; implements the two-phase commit protocol to do distributed transaction commit; uses MySQL group replication for high availability in storage shards; fixes a series of MySQL XA bugs to make distributed transactions highly reliable, among many other enhancements.</description></item><item><title>Database Schema Management Via Liquibase</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/10/01/database-schema-management-via-liquibase/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 22:30:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/10/01/database-schema-management-via-liquibase/</guid><description>Creating the database for an application is simple and easy. However, database script management gets complicated in a hurry when you need to support multiple versions, work with multiple teams, and apply the same changes to multiple types of databases. One open-source tool that helps teams track, version, and deploy database schema changes is Liquibase. It executes database scripts sequentially, allows for the automatic creation and execution of rollback scripts for failed updates, and provides an easy way to use the same scripts and apply them to different types of databases.</description></item><item><title>Google Summer of Code Refactor PMM Framework Project with Percona</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/09/07/google-summer-of-code-refactor-pmm-framework-project-with-percona/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 11:08:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/09/07/google-summer-of-code-refactor-pmm-framework-project-with-percona/</guid><description>I am Meet Patel, 2nd year undergraduate at DAIICT, Gandhinagar, India; pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Information and Communication Technology with a minor in Computational Science.

In this blog post we describe the case when this is not so.
One of the reasons for such behavior is the lesser known limitation of ALTER TABLE (with default ALGORITHM=INPLACE) that avoids REDO operations.

Conversely after moving to a developer role, getting access to real external client workloads to get a perf recording directly is rare. To bridge this gap, I hope to encourage a bit of perf usage to help DBAs report bugs/feature requests in more detail to MySQL developers, who can then serve your needs better.
A recent client request showed how useful perf is in exposing the areas of MySQL that are otherwise well tuned, but can still be in need of coding improvements that increase throughput.</description></item><item><title>Disk of Yesteryear Compared to Today’s SSD Drives</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/01/17/disk-of-yesteryear-compared-to-todays-ssd-drives/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:48:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/01/17/disk-of-yesteryear-compared-to-todays-ssd-drives/</guid><description>In my [last blog post](https://www.percona.com/ community-blog/2019/08/01/how-to-build-a-percona-server-stack-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/) I showed you how to get the entire Percona “Stack&amp;quot; up and running on a Raspberry Pi. This time around, I would like to show the impact on performance between using an SSD hard disk and a standard hard disk.

I have included everything you need to have a complete Percona Server, ready to store data collection for your weather station, your GPS data, or any other project you can think of that would require data collection in a database.</description></item><item><title>MySQL Optimizer: Naughty Aberrations on Queries Combining WHERE, ORDER BY and LIMIT</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/07/29/mysql-optimizer-naughty-aberrations-on-queries-combining-where-order-by-and-limit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 11:50:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/07/29/mysql-optimizer-naughty-aberrations-on-queries-combining-where-order-by-and-limit/</guid><description>Sometimes, the MySQL Optimizer chooses a wrong plan, and a query that should execute in less than 0.1 second ends-up running for 12 minutes!This is not a new problem: bugs about this can be traced back to 2014, and a blog post on this subject was published in 2015.But even if this is old news, because this problem recently came yet again to my attention, and because this is still not fixed in MySQL 5.</description></item><item><title>Impact of innodb_file_per_table Option On Crash Recovery Time</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/07/23/impact-of-innodb_file_per_table-option-on-crash-recovery-time/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 13:34:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/07/23/impact-of-innodb_file_per_table-option-on-crash-recovery-time/</guid><description>Starting at version MySQL5.6+ by default innodb_file_per_table is enabled and all data is stored in separate tablespaces. It provides some advantages.
I will highlight some of them:
You can reclaim disk space when truncating or dropping a table stored in a file-per-table tablespace. Truncating or dropping tables stored in the shared system tablespace creates free space internally in the system tablespace data files (ibdata files) which can only be used for new InnoDB data.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Presents: Globalizing Player Accounts with MySQL at Riot Games</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/05/28/percona-live-presents-globalizing-player-accounts-mysql-riot-games/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 16:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/05/28/percona-live-presents-globalizing-player-accounts-mysql-riot-games/</guid><description>During my presentation at Percona Live 2019, I’ll be talking about how Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, migrated hundreds of millions of player accounts to unlock opportunities for us to delight players.

This is a new MariaDB 10.3 feature, which consists of preserving old versions of a table rows. Each version has two timestamps that indicate the start (INSERT,UPDATE) of the validity of that version, and its end (DELETE, UPDATE). As a result, the user is able to query these tables as they appear at a point in the past, or how data evolved in a certain time range.</description></item><item><title>MySQL Setup at Hostinger Explained</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/12/11/mysql-setup-hostinger-explained/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/12/11/mysql-setup-hostinger-explained/</guid><description>Ever wondered how hosting companies manage their MySQL database architecture?

Currently, there is no easy solution. Just grant access to everything else, individually. Not only does this reduce server performance, but is a nightmare to maintain. Reverse privileges solve this and more.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: Need for speed - Boosting Apache Cassandra's performance using Netty</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/10/22/percona-live-europe-presents-need-speed-boosting-apache-cassandras-performance-using-netty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 08:34:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/10/22/percona-live-europe-presents-need-speed-boosting-apache-cassandras-performance-using-netty/</guid><description>My talk is titled Need for speed: Boosting Apache Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s performance using Netty.

Deadlocks—where two or more transactions are waiting for one another to give up locks before the transactions can proceed successfully—are an unwanted situation. It is a classic problem for all databases including MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle etc. By default, MySQL detects the deadlock condition and to break the deadlock it rolls back one of the transactions.</description></item><item><title>Multi-master with MariaDB 10 - a tutorial</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/10/multi-master-with-mariadb-10-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:57:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/10/multi-master-with-mariadb-10-tutorial/</guid><description>The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to use multi-master to aggregate databases with the same name, but different data from different masters, on the same slave.
