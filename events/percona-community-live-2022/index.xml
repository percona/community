PostgreSQL is one of the most popular open source databases on the planet. According to recent research, it is the most wanted, most loved, and the fastest growing open source database on the market today. As people use PostgreSQL for more and more projects, many of them are falling into the same traps, problems, and issues that many others have.</description></item><item><title>Common Possible Preventative Measures to Avoid Locking Issue in PostgreSQL</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-naveed-shaikh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-naveed-shaikh/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

A common request that we get from our clients is to make MySQL highly available or to enhance existing architecture. We have standardized our approach by combining a proxy layer, for traffic redirection, a topology management tool, for master failover/switchover, and some additional tools to glue together both layers.

Block device incidents are frequent and frightening in production. To achieve high availability, distributed databases usually have fault tolerant strategies to handle these incidents. As the system gets more complicated, it&amp;rsquo;s even hard to prove whether these strategies are working. For example, if the execution and distribution of scheduling commands also depend on the hanging storage, it will have no effect.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Indexing With Postgres</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-bruce-momjian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-bruce-momjian/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

We live in a dangerous world and a catastrophe can happen at any time, including in our database. We can have a hardware failure, software failure, malicious software, or a human error and find ourselves with a data loss. While we work hard to prevent all those some are just not under our control and we cannot rely on luck, we need strategy and methods to be able to recover the maximum data we can in case a catastrophic event happens and this is what we will discuss during this talk.</description></item><item><title>Let's Talk About MySQL Query Tuning</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-gabriel-ciciliani/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-2-gabriel-ciciliani/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

Regardless of development frameworks, despite linters, besides countless sessions with the DBA, slow queries always end up making it to production. Proactive and reactive slow query tuning is still critical to ensure poorly written queries aren&amp;rsquo;t undermining server performance and wasting valuable compute resources. Cloud-based database managed services are not the exception: slow query root cause analysis requires human intervention.</description></item><item><title>Liquibase Data: Version Control and Collaboration for the Database</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-robert-reeves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-1-robert-reeves/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.

Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are intertwined capabilities that attempt to solve problems that defy traditional computational solutions &amp;mdash; problems including fraud detection, voice recognition, and search result recommendations. While they elude simple computation, they are computationally expensive, involving the calculation of perhaps millions of probabilities and weights. These computations can be done outside the database, but there are specific advantages of doing machine learning inside it, close to where the data is stored.</description></item><item><title>PostgreSQL Query Performance Insights</title><link>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/events/percona-community-live-2022/day-3-hamid-akhtar/</guid><description>This session is presented on Percona Community Live Online June 21-23, 2022.
