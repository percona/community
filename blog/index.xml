Percona Everest is the first open source cloud-native platform for provisioning and managing PostgreSQL, MongoDB and MySQL database clusters.
I want to tell you how to install it so you can try it out.
RC builds aren&amp;rsquo;t meant for the general public; we don&amp;rsquo;t support upgrading from RC to stable versions. This means that this is only for testing and familiarizing yourself with the features.</description></item><item><title>Take a Clone it will last longer</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2024/06/02/take-a-clone-it-will-last-longer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2024/06/02/take-a-clone-it-will-last-longer/</guid><description>So cloning is a great subject. I mean we clone sheep, we can clone human organs in time we might be able to clone humans, but thats a topic for scientist and philosophers.
What is MySQL Replicaion:
The MySQL clone plugin can be used to replicate data from a MySQL server to another MySQL server, and it supports replication. The cloning process creates a physical snapshot of the data, including tables, schemas, tablespaces, and data dictionary metadata.</description></item><item><title>Learn PostgreSQL and SQL Quickly and Free</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2024/05/20/learn-postgresql-and-sql-quickly-and-free/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2024/05/20/learn-postgresql-and-sql-quickly-and-free/</guid><description>Learn PostgreSQL and SQL Quickly and Free

A key part of our DBA team’s process in testing and preparing for major MySQL version upgrades is comparing query plans using ProxySQL query mirroring. This feature allows us to mirror queries to another cluster / host, by configuring query rules. What makes mirroring particularly useful is the ability to selectively mirror queries based on the query digest, or client user.</description></item><item><title>Release Roundup April 30, 2024</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2024/04/30/release-roundup-april-30-2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2024/04/30/release-roundup-april-30-2024/</guid><description>Percona software releases and updates April 17 - April 30, 2024.

One way to achieve data isolation for each client is to create a separate MySQL database for each tenant.
Some advantages of this approach are:
It allows for easy backup and restore of individual tenant data. It simplifies the database administration and maintenance tasks, as each database can be managed independently.</description></item><item><title>Our Top Picks from the Kubernetes 1.29 Release</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2024/01/12/our-top-picks-from-the-kubernetes-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2024/01/12/our-top-picks-from-the-kubernetes-release/</guid><description>The latest Kubernetes version, 1.29, was released on December 13th 2023.

They were in search of a solution to improve automated container management within Kubernetes, primarily with the goal of incorporating operational expertise directly into the software.
According to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, “Operators are software extensions that use custom resources to manage applications and their components”.
Kubernetes is designed for automation, offering essential automation features.

Recently, Percona team announced the public alpha version of a new open source product – Percona Everest. It allows you to create database clusters on Kubernetes cluster.
I have installed Percona Everest several times and tried its features. Standard installation is very simple and takes a few minutes.
But, to understand the product deeper, I came up with the idea to explore repositories, build and run Percona Everest from source.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Community Days UK: Keynote Cilium and eBPF</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/10/24/kcduk-cilium-ebpf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/10/24/kcduk-cilium-ebpf/</guid><description>This week, at Kubernetes Community Days UK in London.

Usually, this comes from the fact that PMM or standalone people run node_exporter inside a container. PMM does it as a sidecar along with many other exporters to monitor DBs, and node_exporter comes out of the box as a default one. So people could see accurate data on dashboards, like Memory and CPU, that node_exporter reads inside the container.</description></item><item><title>Binding your application to the database in the Kubernetes cluster</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/24/k8s-app-db-binding/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/24/k8s-app-db-binding/</guid><description>dbaas-operator is Yet Another DBaaS Kubernetes Operator (need to suggest yadbko as a name) that tries to simplify and unify Database Cluster deployments by building a higher abstraction layer on top of Percona Kubernetes Operators.
So it becomes much easier to deploy the DB cluster with dbaas-operator and PMM DBaaS on top of it.
But another part of the picture is applications and their workloads to connect to the deployed DB Clusters.</description></item><item><title>Percona Monitoring and Management 2.34 preview release</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/17/preview-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2023/01/17/preview-release/</guid><description>Percona Monitoring and Management 2.34 preview release Hello folks!

Lincoln said, &amp;ldquo;Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, and for the people&amp;rdquo;. Similarly, Open Source is software of the community, by the community, and for the community.
Formally, Open Source refers to projects or programs whose source code can be modified, shared, and/or commercialized by the public/community at will. A license that is attached to an Open Source project determines the extent to which the project can be consumed, modified, or utilized.</description></item><item><title>Learning Kubernetes Operators with Percona Operator for MongoDB</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/13/learning-kubernetes-operators-with-percona-operator-for-mongodb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/13/learning-kubernetes-operators-with-percona-operator-for-mongodb/</guid><description>One of the topics that have resonated a lot for me since the first KubeCon I attended in 2018 is Kubernetes Operators.
The concept of Operators was introduced much earlier in 2016 by the CoreOS Linux development team. They were looking for a way to improve automated container management in Kubernetes.
What do we mean by a Kubernetes Operator? We use the definition of CNCF. The Kubernetes project defines “Operator” simply: “Operators are software extensions that use custom resources to manage applications and their components“.</description></item><item><title>Recap Monthly Percona Developer Meetup Hacktoberfest</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/05/recap-monthly-percona-developer-meetup-hacktoberfest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/10/05/recap-monthly-percona-developer-meetup-hacktoberfest/</guid><description>The Monthly Percona Developer Meetup is an opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes view of different projects in Percona and directly interact with the experts to exchange ideas, ask questions, etc.

We are indeed excited to announce that the new release of VictoriaMetrics has many exciting features, one of them being downsampling.
Downsampling helps to reduce disk space usage and improves query performance in a big and long time series if applied independently per each time series. However, this feature works only with a large number of samples per series.
As we are keen on implementing downsampling in our future releases, we would like to understand how long you keep your metrics in PMM.</description></item><item><title>How to Publish a Blog Post</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/10/how-to-publish-blog-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2022/02/10/how-to-publish-blog-post/</guid><description>If you write technical content or just want to become an author, this blog is open to you!

Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI (Open Container Initiative) Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be run as root or in rootless mode. More details here.
Check out also Kubernetes Podcast to learn more about podman and listen to it&amp;rsquo;s creators.
Why to replace? Especially in development I need simplest possible solution, I don&amp;rsquo;t need additional daemon running or allowing something to run with elevated privileges.</description></item><item><title>Percona Supports Community Events - Organize Yours With Us!</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/12/23/community-events-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/12/23/community-events-support/</guid><description>One of the things we love doing in Percona is participating in community events and inspiring people to stay connected in the changing world.

Oracle/MySQL define a GTID as "A global transaction identifier (GTID) is a unique identifier created and associated with each transaction committed on the server of origin (the source). This identifier is unique not only to the server on which it originated, but is unique across all servers in a given replication topology."

Add the use of GTID’s and you have a very stable solution.
The fundamental issue with async replication is that writes sent to the Replica are not guaranteed to be written. I have only seen a handful of times when writes did not get applied to the replica. Most of the time this happens is due to network packet drops or a replica crashes before new data is committed.</description></item><item><title>Create your own Exporter in Go!</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/07/21/create-your-own-exporter-in-go/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/07/21/create-your-own-exporter-in-go/</guid><description>Overview Hi, it’s too hot summer in Korea.

According to the goal to involve open source contributors to contribute to PMM and Percona to contribute to open source. As the main focus, it was decided to start from the exporter.
For now PMM use the next exporters:
https://github.com/percona/node_exporter https://github.com/percona/mysqld_exporter https://github.com/percona/mongodb_exporter https://github.com/percona/postgres_exporter https://github.com/Percona-Lab/clickhouse_exporter https://github.com/percona/proxysql_exporter https://github.com/percona/rds_exporter https://github.com/percona/azure_metrics_exporter Groups We can split them into three groups.</description></item><item><title>How to Speed Up Re Sync of Dropped Percona Xtradb Cluster Node</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2021/02/24/how-to-speed-up-re-sync-of-dropped-percona-xtradb-cluster-node/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2021/02/24/how-to-speed-up-re-sync-of-dropped-percona-xtradb-cluster-node/</guid><description>The Problem HELP, HELP!

Abstract At Yelp, Cassandra, our NoSQL database of choice, has been deployed on AWS compute (EC2) and AutoScaling Groups (ASG), backed by Block Storage (EBS). This deployment model has been quite robust over the years while presenting its own set of challenges. To make our Cassandra deployment more resilient and reduce the engineering toil associated with our constantly growing infrastructure, we are abstracting Cassandra deployments further away from EC2 with Kubernetes and orchestrating with our Cassandra Operator.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Tracing for Finding and Solving MariaDB (and MySQL) Performance Problems on Linux - Percona Live ONLINE Talk Preview</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/05/05/dynamic-tracing-for-finding-and-solving-mariadb-and-mysql-performance-problems-on-linux-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 21:13:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/05/05/dynamic-tracing-for-finding-and-solving-mariadb-and-mysql-performance-problems-on-linux-percona-live-online-talk-preview/</guid><description>Percona Live Online Agenda Slot (CORRECTED): Wed 20 May • New York 6:00 a.m. • London 11:00 a.m. • New Delhi 3:30 p.m. Level: Advanced

In this blog post we describe the case when this is not so.
One of the reasons for such behavior is the lesser known limitation of ALTER TABLE (with default ALGORITHM=INPLACE) that avoids REDO operations. As a result, all dirty pages of the altered table/tablespace have to be flushed before the ALTER TABLE completion.</description></item><item><title>Our Offer to Online Meetups and Community Leaders</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/04/07/our-offer-to-online-meetups-and-community-leaders/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 10:52:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/04/07/our-offer-to-online-meetups-and-community-leaders/</guid><description>Percona’s Community team organizes our speakers at in-person events around the world, such as Percona Live, Percona University, and events sponsored by other organizations.

Conversely after moving to a developer role, getting access to real external client workloads to get a perf recording directly is rare. To bridge this gap, I hope to encourage a bit of perf usage to help DBAs report bugs/feature requests in more detail to MySQL developers, who can then serve your needs better.
A recent client request showed how useful perf is in exposing the areas of MySQL that are otherwise well tuned, but can still be in need of coding improvements that increase throughput.</description></item><item><title>How To Contribute to PMM Documentation</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2020/01/28/how-to-contribute-to-pmm-documentation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 16:43:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2020/01/28/how-to-contribute-to-pmm-documentation/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;d love to see more contributions towards the development and improvement of Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), one of Percona&amp;rsquo;s most valued projects.

It provides some advantages.
I will highlight some of them:
You can reclaim disk space when truncating or dropping a table stored in a file-per-table tablespace. Truncating or dropping tables stored in the shared system tablespace creates free space internally in the system tablespace data files (ibdata files) which can only be used for new InnoDB data.</description></item><item><title>The Concept of Materialized Views in MongoDB Sharded Clusters</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/07/16/concept-materialized-views-mongodb-sharded-clusters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 10:14:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/07/16/concept-materialized-views-mongodb-sharded-clusters/</guid><description>In one of my past blogs I explained the contribution of MongoDB® views in organization security.

I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering the main phases of the MySQL optimizer and its optimization strategies, including query transformations, data access strategies, the range optimizer, the join optimizer, and subquery optimization.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Presents: Vitess – Running Sharded MySQL on Kubernetes</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/04/18/percona-live-presents-vitess-running-sharded-mysql-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 17:19:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/04/18/percona-live-presents-vitess-running-sharded-mysql-kubernetes/</guid><description>The topic I&amp;rsquo;m presenting addresses a growing and unfulfilled need: the ability to run stateful workloads in Kubernetes. Running stateless applications is now considered a solved problem. However, it&amp;rsquo;s currently not practical to put databases like MySQL in containers, give them to Kubernetes, and expect it to manage their life cycles.

Communities are the real strength of open source. Not just the theoretical ability to study, modify and share code – but the fact that other people out there are doing these things. Creating a base of knowledge and a network of relations.These can become work relationships, valuable discussions, open source tools, or even friendships.
That is why, when I heard that several people from the Percona support team will soon be in London, I badly wanted to organise an event.</description></item><item><title>#ilovefs Valentine's Day Celebration (I Love Free Software)</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/02/14/ilovefs-valentines-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 10:21:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/02/14/ilovefs-valentines-day/</guid><description>Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is celebrating the creators of free software with their I Love Free Software campaign #ilovefs, a social campaign for Valentine’s Day.

This is a new MariaDB 10.3 feature, which consists of preserving old versions of a table rows. Each version has two timestamps that indicate the start (INSERT,UPDATE) of the validity of that version, and its end (DELETE, UPDATE). As a result, the user is able to query these tables as they appear at a point in the past, or how data evolved in a certain time range.</description></item><item><title>MySQL Setup at Hostinger Explained</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/12/11/mysql-setup-hostinger-explained/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/12/11/mysql-setup-hostinger-explained/</guid><description>Ever wondered how hosting companies manage their MySQL database architecture?

Currently, there is no easy solution. Just grant access to everything else, individually. Not only does this reduce server performance, but is a nightmare to maintain. Reverse privileges solve this and more.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Europe Presents: Need for speed - Boosting Apache Cassandra's performance using Netty</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/10/22/percona-live-europe-presents-need-speed-boosting-apache-cassandras-performance-using-netty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 08:34:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/10/22/percona-live-europe-presents-need-speed-boosting-apache-cassandras-performance-using-netty/</guid><description>My talk is titled Need for speed: Boosting Apache Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s performance using Netty.

Deadlocks—where two or more transactions are waiting for one another to give up locks before the transactions can proceed successfully—are an unwanted situation. It is a classic problem for all databases including MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle etc. By default, MySQL detects the deadlock condition and to break the deadlock it rolls back one of the transactions.</description></item><item><title>Multi-master with MariaDB 10 - a tutorial</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/10/multi-master-with-mariadb-10-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 13:57:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2018/09/10/multi-master-with-mariadb-10-tutorial/</guid><description>The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to use multi-master to aggregate databases with the same name, but different data from different masters, on the same slave.
