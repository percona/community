Percona offers Terraform provider for easy installation of Percona Server for MySQL and PMM in AWS and Google Cloud.

Terraform offers the following benefits:

1. Automation: Terraform automates the process of creating, updating, and managing infrastructure, reducing the risk of errors and increasing efficiency.
2. Versioning: Terraform allows you to version control your infrastructure, making it easier to track changes and collaborate with others.
3. Scalability: Terraform makes it easy to scale infrastructure up or down, so you can quickly adapt to changing needs.
4. Reusability: Terraform provides reusable infrastructure components, so you don't have to recreate the same infrastructure for different projects or environments.
5. Portability: Terraform's infrastructure as code approach makes it easy to move infrastructure between different cloud providers or data centers.
