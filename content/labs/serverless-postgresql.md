Percona offers builds for Serverless PostgreSQL which are based on [Neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon)

This solution provides a serverless experience for PostgreSQL by dividing the compute nodes and storage nodes, allowing the storage to be scaled as your data grows and making the process transparent for end-users.


## Branching data

Have you ever wanted the ability to fork your data set and work on it independently, similar to using Git branches? This can now be achieved with ease using Serverless PostgreSQL. Simply fork your data, conduct experiments, and have peace of mind knowing that your primary data set remains unaffected.

## Interested?

Builds and instructions are coming soon.
