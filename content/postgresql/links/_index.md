Contributing to the PostgreSQL community is not just about coding or providing new enhancements. Often the most valuable contributions are not code, they come in the form of bug reports, feedback, testing beta’s and of course giving back your experience to the community through blogs, videos, and other mechanisms. If you are willing to help let us know! We are always looking for great content to help make the PostgreSQL community even better. Share your experiences though a guide or tutorial with us and get a free hat! 

Percona is committed to helping the PostgreSQL community grow and learn. Over the last year the team at Percona has written over 50 PostgreSQL articles geared toward educating and teaching what we learned as we helped our customers. Those posts have been viewed over 300K times. In addition we have also helped deliver, build, or give a platform for over 400 hours of conference talks, videos, and training specifically geared towards PostgreSQL (Many available for free on youtube right now!).  

Here to learn about PostgreSQL? Check out some of the great free content below we have contributed to the ecosystem or that have been delivered as part of our conferences!  When the PostgreSQL community grows we all benefit!
