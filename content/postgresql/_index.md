The PostgreSQL community is a vibrant community with tons of awesome tools, extension, and projects. In fact Github has over 58K different PostgreSQL projects and there are 100’s of extensions out in the wild . With so many components in the ecosystem it can be confusing to figure out which things work with which. Percona’s Distribution for PostgreSQL has tried to cultivate the best of these into a single package. We would love for you to try it out, give us feedback, or contribute.
