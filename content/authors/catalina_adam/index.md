I’m a technical writer with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry. I have a master's degree in Technical Communication from the University of Portsmouth, UK, and I know my way around a wide range of content authoring tools—DITA, GitHub, MKDocs, Visual Studio Code, Oxygen, wikis, SDL LiveContent, FrameMaker, Flare, RoboHelp, and more.

I specialize in making complex information clear, structured, and easy to understand so that users and teams can work with technology seamlessly. Whether it’s documentation, technical guides, or knowledge bases, I love transforming messy information into something accessible and useful.
