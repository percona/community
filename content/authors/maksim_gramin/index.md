Maksim has been working with various database sysytems for about 15 years. He was a SQL developer on big distributed teams, writing tons of nontrivial SQL-queries and implementing tons of complex and tricky business logic on the database side. And he also worked as a “classical” Java developer and architect, where people interacted with any databases through ORM's.

For now Maksim is a database consultant and researcher.
