During my career I have built up a vast experience within IT. From IT systems administration and data migration through business analysis, solution architecture, project management and product management.

I have had a pleasure of working with quite a few implementations of Agile workflows with both teams on site and remote ones. I still find it very motivating that with each team and each software development process there is place for improvement and that each situation brings opportunity for both business and personal growth.
