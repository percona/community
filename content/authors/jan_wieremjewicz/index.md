Jan is a Senior Product Manager at Percona, leading the products for PostgreSQL. He has vast experience in the development, deployment and maintenance of enterprise systems. 

Professionally, he is passionate about simple solutions that solve complicated problems and user experience that maximizes the product potential. 

Privately he is a foodie by day, a tech geek into graphic novels, video and board games by night and parent/spouse in between. 

Having spent already almost three years in Percona, most of us learned that he has enough energy and topics to fill in any space and time.
