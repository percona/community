Ibrar Ahmed is a Software Architect in Percona LLC. Prior to coming to open source development, he had vast experience in software design and development. His main focus was on system-level embedded development. After joining EnterpriseDB in 2006, an Enterprise PostgreSQL company, he started his career in open source development specifically in PostgreSQL. He has contributed to the PostgreSQL community as well as other open source communities. His contribution ranges from the main performance feature enhancements to various PostgreSQL modules. In the database field, he has experience in other well-known databases MySQL, Oracle, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Hadoop. His experience is not limited to core databases, but with the tools related to databases like Hive, HBase, and Spark. He also worked on integrating these tools with PostgreSQL.
