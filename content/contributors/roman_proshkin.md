Roman Proskin, senior developer at Mail.ru Group. For the last few years I am working on Tarantool — an in-memory computing platform. I have developed and deployed to production several projects focused on high availability and performance. My current project involves a major commercial bank, where I manage everything from monitoring and logging to CI/CD.
