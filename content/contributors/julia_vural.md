As a Software Engineering Manager at Percona, I have over 23 years of experience in software development, leadership, and innovation. 

I am passionate about delivering high-quality software solutions that leverage agile methodologies, DevOps culture, and microservices architecture. I lead the effort on a cloud-friendly framework that is based on Angular, .Net Core, Elastic Search, Fluentd, Kibana, Jaeger, Rabbit MQ, Jasper Reports, Docker, and Kubernetes, and achieved a 40% improvement in development speed. I also have a master's and a PhD degree in computer engineering, and I constantly seek to learn new technologies and skills.
