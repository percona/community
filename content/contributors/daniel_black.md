After a reasonable amount of time doing development and IT security work, Daniel landed a DBA Consultant job and loved it.

After writing a few too many bug fixes without a client to bill them to, he joined IBM to make MariaDB and MySQL scale on IBM POWER.

The love for the community brought him to MariaDB Foundation where he embraces the innovation of contributors and users to make MariaDB better for everyone.
