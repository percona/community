I joined MySQL AB in January 2006, working remotely from my home in Brisbane, Australia.

I used the opportunity of working remotely to relocate to Canada. In 2008, after Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL, I joined Percona. I later rejoined the MySQL team under Oracle and worked as Product Manager for the MySQL Server until 2017.

I live in the Canadian Rockies with my wife, kids, and dog. I’m a fulltime employee of PingCAP, where we are building a horizontally scalable NewSQL database that speaks the MySQL protocol.
