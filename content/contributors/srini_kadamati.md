I'm a Senior Data Scientist that's on a mission to enable more people to work with data effectively. I spent 5 years building an online learning platform specifically to help people learn existing data tools before turning my attention to improving the data tools themselves. I now am a Developer Advocate at Preset.io, the main company driving and helping grow the Apache Superset project.
