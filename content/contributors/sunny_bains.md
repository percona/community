Sunny Bains has been working on database internals since 2001. Before joining PingCAP in 2022 he was a Senior Director of Software Development at Oracle where led the MySQL/InnoDB team. He fixed the performance bottlenecks that made InnoDB scale to where it is today. He is also the main author of the Full Text Search in InnoDB, B+Tree parallel read, DDL and more things that he can remember. Before joining Oracle in 2006 he implemented a database storage engine from scratch for a distributed database product at CTI Pty. Ltd. The networked database was used in a mission critical environment in the airline industry with very strict service level guarantees.
