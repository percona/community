Laura is a Developer Ecosystem Leader with over 20 years of experience building and scaling high-impact technical communities. She began her career in Software QA, a technical foundation that led her to discover a passion for open source and a natural transition into community management and leadership. From her foundational leadership at the University of Limerick to serving on Ubuntu’s Community Council and EMEA Membership Board, Laura has dedicated her career to the art of community governance.

She specialises in designing engagement strategies and incentive structures that resonate with developers in both agile startups and global enterprises. Based in Godalming, she remains an active community builder outside of tech through local tennis leagues, and shares her home with her two dogs, Pixel and Kernel. She is always ready to discuss open-source strategy or her definitive guide to navigating Disney World.
