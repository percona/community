Gabe Weiss had a first career as an actor and shifted into tech. He has found a job that neatly marries both of his careers into one job. Being a developer advocate means he gets the freedom to continually learn new skills and new ways of doing things, and then turn around and teach others how to do it. Through speaking in public, videos and blogs, he gets to reach a wide audience.
