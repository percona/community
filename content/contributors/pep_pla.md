Pep has been working with databases all his life. Born in a small village by the Mediterranean, he currently lives in Barcelona. He loves tech, traveling, good food, music and, all things NASA. He hates talking about himself in the third person and has a particular sense of humor. Happily married, he is the father of three boys and two cats.
