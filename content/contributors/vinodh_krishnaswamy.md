Vinodh Krishnaswamy is a Support Engineer at Percona.
Vinodh loves to work in a team as a team player, leading the team, solving problems and partying with them. His friends/colleagues call him "Guruji", who shares the knowledge. He agreed to join our community meetup and to share his knowledge about MongoDB. He helped many clients to move into MongoDB and solved their problem to deal with huge data and reducing the focus on Normalization / design of RDBMS & focus on handling data.
