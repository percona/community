Chris was always fascinated by systems and data integration between on-premises systems, clouds, and their combination. As a Solutions Architect at Google Cloud (Google, Inc.) he is focusing on databases, data migration, multi-cloud database deployments, and data integration in enterprise customer settings. Earlier in his career, Chris contributed to Enterprise Application System Integration (EAI), Business-to-Business Integration (B2B) as well as workflow management. In addition to implementing these technologies, he wrote several books on these topics and is publishing actively (see his professional page at www.real-programmer.com).
