Formerly at MySQL AB, and then through acquisitions at Sun Microsystems and Oracle, and currently at VMware through a merge.

I am active member of the MySQL community and long timer open source enthusiast. During the past decades I have worked in various IT related elds, with focus on databases, software development, quality assurance, and system administration. Fluent in Italian, English, Go, Spanish, SQL, Bash, and good speaker of C, French, and Perl. I work in cyberspace, with a virtual team.
