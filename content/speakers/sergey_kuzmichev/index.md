Sergey is a support engineer in Percona. Interested in all things databases, he's currently working mainly with MySQL and PostgreSQL. He started his career working as an Oracle DBA, later moving to a DevOps engineer role supporting a Java-based trading platform running on PostgreSQL. After being a jack of all trades for a while, he's now focusing on what he enjoys most: open source databases, systems performance, and reliability.
