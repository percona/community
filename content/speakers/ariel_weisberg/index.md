Currently working on Presto @ Facebook.

Previous was Apache Cassandra committer and PMC member

Before that I was the third engineer to start working on VoltDB back when it was incubating in Vertica and we called it Horizontica.

I enjoy developing scalable, reliable, consistently fast distributed systems and applications built on distributed systems as well as enabling other developers to be successful in selecting and using said systems through design, documentation, and implementation.
