## Abstract

In the fast-paced world of fintech, the pressure to deliver innovative solutions while controlling costs is relentless. Cloud-native architectures offer a path to agility and scalability, but the choice of database technology is critical. This talk explores how open source databases, optimized for cloud-native environments, can be the cornerstone of a cost-conscious and high-performing infrastructure.
Many financial institutions rely on open source databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. These databases offer in conjunction with Kubernetes and the broader CNCF ecosystem offer powerful tools to optimize resource utilization, automate database management, and significantly reduce operational costs. The next evolution of controlling costs when managing your data on Kubernetes is Percona Everest. Everest is an open source platform that empowers enterprises to streamline database operations across diverse environments, ensuring a seamless user experience without sacrificing features or falling prey to vendor lock-in - a perfect compliment to financial institutions need for scalable, cost effective and efficient solutions.
