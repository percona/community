## Abstract

In the world of PostgreSQL database management, ensuring robust and efficient backup strategies is crucial for maintaining data integrity and availability.  pgBackRest , a powerful open-source tool, has become the preferred solution for many organizations seeking a comprehensive and flexible backup system. This talk, titled  "pgBackRest: Elevating Your PostgreSQL Backup Game" , aims to introduce database administrators to the essential features of utilizing pgBackRest to protect their PostgreSQL environments.
The presentation will cover the fundamentals of pgBackRest, including installation, configuration, and core concepts such as stanzas, repositories, and different types of backups (full, differential, and incremental). A hands-on demonstration will showcase the practical use of pgBackRest, walking participants through configuring a backup setup, performing backups, and restoring the backups. A  brief overview of advanced features, such as remote backups, multi-repository support, encryption, parallel backup, and many more will be provided to give participants a glimpse into more complex configurations.
Finally, the talk will conclude with an introduction to a  LinkedIn Learning course on pgBackRest ( https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fpostgresql-backup-and-restore-with-pgbackrest%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3Dn6RVdsNUSW2%252FiGHupCpkHQ%253D%253D ), which I created and was launched in April 2024. This course offers an in-depth exploration of its capabilities and real-world applications. This presentation will equip attendees with a solid foundation in pgBackRest, empowering them to elevate their PostgreSQL backup strategies and ensure data resilience in their production environments.
