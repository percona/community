## Abstract

Think you have to choose between the convenience of Azure's managed databases and the deep control of self-hosting? Think again.

For many developers and DBAs, this is a daily struggle. Managed PaaS offerings like Azure Cosmos DB are fantastic for speed but can become a "black box" when you need full MongoDB compatibility or granular control over performance and cost. On the other end, running databases on VMs gives you total control but brings back the manual, error-prone operational work we moved to the cloud to escape.

This session proves there is a better way. We'll show you how to build a superior DBaaS platform using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the foundation. We'll cut straight to the chase and demonstrate how the open-source Percona Operator for MongoDB transforms a standard Kubernetes cluster into a true DBaaS. Forget manual setups; you will see how to automate the entire database lifecycle, including provisioning, high-availability, scaling, and backups with ease. To complete the picture, we’ll showcase Percona Everest as the 'easy button' for simplifying day-2 operations across your entire database fleet.

Join this session to learn how to build a flexible, powerful, and cost-efficient document database service on Azure that puts you firmly back in the driver's seat—fully on your own terms.
