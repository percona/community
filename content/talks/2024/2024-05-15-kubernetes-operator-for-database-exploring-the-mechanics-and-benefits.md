## Abstract

In this talk, we will focus specifically on Kubernetes Operators applied to databases. We will begin with an introduction to Kubernetes, illustrating how a typical application is deployed and managed in this environment and the difficulties that exist when implementing a database in Kubernetes. Next, we will detail what Kubernetes Operators are and their critical importance in effective database management on Kubernetes platforms. We will discuss how Operators offer an automated solution for complex tasks such as scaling, updating, and monitoring databases, significantly simplifying these processes. Attendees will gain a deep understanding of the benefits that Kubernetes Operators bring to database management, along with practical examples that illustrate their effectiveness in production environments. The talk is ideal for those looking to understand how Operators can improve efficiency and scalability in managing databases in Kubernetes.
