## Abstract

Data on Kubernetes is well-positioned to become the operational default in a world where data and AI/ML applications are expected to grow. Scalability, flexibility, resilience, openness, and costs are among the reasons; and it has a transformative impact on organizations who benefit from increased productivity, revenue growth, market share and margin, according to the 2022 Data on Kubernetes Report. Panelists from the Data on Kubernetes Community (DoKC) will discuss drivers for this movement, why Kubernetes is well positioned, and advances in the data on Kubernetes (DoK) ecosystem including storage, operators, auto-scaling, networking and others. We’ll consider how Kubernetes features align with trends in data data management like separation of storage and compute. We will discuss ways that Kubernetes improves alignment with data management and also review capabilities like object storage that are best left to applications.
