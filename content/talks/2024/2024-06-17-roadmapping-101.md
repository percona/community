## Abstract

This session introduces the fundamentals of product roadmapping, focusing on why roadmaps matter, how different approaches serve different contexts and how to choose the right level of structure and detail. It explores roadmaps as a communication and alignment tool rather than a fixed plan, connecting vision, goals, priorities, and outcomes over time. Through practical frameworks and examples, the talk highlights how teams can navigate uncertainty, balance value and effort, and make better decisions about what to build next without overcommitting to dates or features.
