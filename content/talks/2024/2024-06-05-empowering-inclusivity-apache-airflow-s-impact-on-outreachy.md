## Abstract

In this presentation, we will delve into the important role that Apache Airflow plays in the Outreachy program and its broader influence in closing inclusion gaps within the open source community. We will explore the success stories and transformative experiences of Outreachy contributors, emphasizing how this open source project has created opportunities for people from diverse backgrounds. Our discussion will focus on the power of open source initiatives like Apache Airflow to foster a more inclusive and accessible technology ecosystem. Join us as we discover how Outreachy is making significant strides toward greater inclusion and diversity in the world of technology and open source, with this talk we will celebrate Outreachy's major milestone that reached 1,000 interns. Let's celebrate this achievement together!
