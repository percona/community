## Abstract

We’ve all heard the saying “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey,” well the same can be said of database Operators. It’s not about which Operator you are using to deploy your database to Kubernetes it’s about what you are trying to accomplish with what you are deploying.
A quick search on  OperatorHub.io  lists 49 Database focused Operators and 11 PostgreSQL operators. Each have their own speciality and each have their own lifecycle. Choosing one today as it’s best fitting may no longer be the case soon. I argue that ranking one as better than the next is ineffective, instead you should be focused on the ‘what do I want to do,’ with my database deployment.
This talk will focus on how to use the newest concepts in scaleable database deployment to stop worrying about the “how” and refocus again on the “what”.
