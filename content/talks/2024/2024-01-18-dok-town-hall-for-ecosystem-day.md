## Abstract

Running databases on Kubernetes is often seen as complex, especially when it comes to day-2 operations such as scaling, backups, upgrades, and recovery. This talk explores how  Percona Kubernetes Operators  simplify and automate database operations for open-source databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Attendees will learn how operators extend the Kubernetes API to manage stateful workloads, enable consistent automation, and integrate with existing Infrastructure-as-Code tools. The session also highlights how these operators allow teams to run databases reliably across cloud and on-premises environments without vendor lock-in, and looks ahead at Percona’s direction in the cloud-native ecosystem.
