## Abstract

As Kubernetes celebrates its 10th anniversary, it’s an opportune moment to reflect on the significant innovations it has introduced to the world of databases.
This session will take you on a journey through the evolution of database management on Kubernetes. We will highlight key milestones, transformative trends, and best practices. From the early days of stateful applications to the cloud-native database solutions we have today, Kubernetes has revolutionized how we deploy, scale, and manage data. We’ll explore developments such as the appearance of StatefulSets, the rise of Kubernetes Operators, and the integration of advanced storage solutions. Through a timeline shaped by community contributions, we will show the technologies associated with databases on Kubernetes.
We will also showcase real-world use cases, learn about the latest tools and techniques, and explore the landscape of databases on Kubernetes. This talk is perfect for those considering migrating their databases to Kubernetes and wondering if they can do it. It is also suitable for both beginners and experienced individuals who want to see the evolution of stateful applications on Kubernetes.
