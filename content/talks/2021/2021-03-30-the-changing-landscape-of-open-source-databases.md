## Abstract

A discussion on the changes, trends, and database technologies that are going to impact business by the end of 2021.

In the current technology landscape, we have a lot of great innovation happening especially when it comes to Database Technology. A few examples include introducing new data models such as time series or graph, which focus on solving SQL at hyper-scale problem, this has been an elusive solution and scale was becoming synonymous with NoSQL environments. We now have a new Cloud-Native database design coming to market using the power of Kubernetes as well as employing Serverless concepts.

In this presentation, we will look at database technologies changing trends and what is driving them as well as talk about changes to the Open Source licenses and Cloud-based deployment and emerging class of not-quite Open Source Database software.
