## Abstract

PostgreSQL has a great support for JSON, including proper indexes, and we'll demonstrate how to get the best of the usage of the support it has and how to extend it. We'll understand the difference of both JSON and JSONB types and also how and when to use the indexes offered by Postgres within the JSON types context. You might get surprised of the power, flexibility and performance that can be achieved using JSON with Postgres!
