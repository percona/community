## Abstract

In this wide-ranging state of the market keynote, Peter will be discussing a range of recent themes and developments. In the current technology landscape, we have a lot of great innovation happening especially when it comes to Database Technology. These include the overall growth of open source and how this might have been impacted by Covid-19. We now have a new Cloud-Native database design coming to market using the power of Kubernetes as well as employing Serverless concepts. Introducing new data models such as time series or graph, which focus on solving SQL at hyper-scale problem, this has been an elusive solution and scale was becoming synonymous with NoSQL environments.

In this presentation, we will look at database technologies changing trends and what is driving them: the role of the public cloud – is this be good or bad for open source, whether licensing changes could change the direction of open-source software, the top reasons companies choose open source software.
