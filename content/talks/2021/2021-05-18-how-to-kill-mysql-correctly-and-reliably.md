## Abstract

Over the years of working with teams in Russia and abroad, I have seen various variations of attempts to kill the database. Unfortunately, such attempts are often ineffective and often lead to only partial inaccessibility of the database.

In this talk, we will look at these attempts, learn how to kill your MySQL with a guarantee, and also consider options for building a guaranteed bad production infrastructure and useless test benches.

Sveta Smirnova was a co-speaker of Vladimir Fedorkov.
