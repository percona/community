## Abstract

What’s the future of the open-source industry-standard for MySQL hot backup?

A brief overview of the current state of the backup tool, architecture, MySQL 8.0 support, new cloud native features, and the roadmap.

During this brief lecture, I will present the roadmap for Percona XtraBackup, talk about the importance of our Cloud direction, why PXB 8.0 is a separate binary, and how PXB fits into our Percona Distribution model for 2020.
