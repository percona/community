## Abstract

A session about benchmarking MySQL and disk IO subsystems with sysbench and interpreting the results. In our consulting company, I helped a reasonable number of customers with sysbench so I know the common caveats most people run into. This talk will cover benchmarking IO subsystems with fileio tests, as well as benchmarking MySQL.
