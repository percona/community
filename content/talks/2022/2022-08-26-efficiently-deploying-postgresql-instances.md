## Abstract

We will review how to deploy PostgreSQL environments and be able to have any version of PostgreSQL running within minutes... or even seconds\! You will learn what cool tools the Percona Support team uses to efficiently deploy everything from standalone servers to more complex replication and HA topologies.

After attending, you will have all the knowledge you need to start testing your applications against fully functional PostgreSQL instances... fast\!
