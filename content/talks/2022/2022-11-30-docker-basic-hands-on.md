## Abstract

This hands-on session introduces Docker and explains how containers simplify application development by eliminating the “it works on my machine” problem. Attendees will learn the core concepts of Docker, including installation options, basic components, and Docker architecture, and how containers differ from virtual machines. Through a live demo with essential Docker commands, the talk provides practical experience in building and running containers. The session also covers recent updates in the Docker ecosystem, Docker Extensions, WebAssembly integration, and ways to get involved in the Docker community.
