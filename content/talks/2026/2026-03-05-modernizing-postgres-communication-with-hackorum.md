## Abstract

Modernizing Postgres Communication with Hackorum  In 2026, the debate over whether mailing lists are still "state of the art" continues to divide developers. While some view them as relics, we cannot neglect the unique benefits of their decentralized, archival nature. Rather than fighting over platforms or ignoring the friction, Hackorum asks a simpler question: Why not just improve the user experience?Hackorum transforms the daunting mailing list "firehose" into a modern, forum-style interface without breaking the underlying email culture. It is designed to lower the barrier for new contributors while providing power tools for veterans:Seamless Integration: Real-time sync between mailing lists and daily sync of the Commitfest status.Modern UX: Per-message read tracking, tagging, and contributor profiles.Enhanced Coordination: Shared notes and mentions to streamline complex reviews.We have to stay open minded and willing to expand our horizon and as such Hackorum is rapidly evolving. While our roots are in development, we are currently expanding to include broader mailing lists like -general and -docs. Our goal is to make the entire Postgres ecosystem more accessible and usable for everyone. Join us for a demo of the latest updates and help us shape the future of Postgres communication.  https://hackorum.dev/
