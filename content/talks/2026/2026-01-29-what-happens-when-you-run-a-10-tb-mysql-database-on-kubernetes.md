## Abstract

That's the question many of our customers and users asked and honestly, we were extremely curious ourselves.So, I ditched the weekend plans, rolled up my sleeves, and jumped down the rabbit hole. What I found was far more challenging (and perhaps a bit more "psychedelic") than expected. I/we spent days rigorously testing the Percona Operator for PXC at massive scale.This presentation distills all our findings into the most critical, actionable advice you need to ensure your high-scale environment not only survives but operates reliably.
