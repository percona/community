## Abstract

The JSON data type was introduced in MySQL 5.7 and was dramatically improved in version 8.0. Chief among these changes was the introduction of JSON_TABLE(), which temporarily transforms JSON data into structured data for processing with SQL commands such as window functions. And you also gain the ability to test JSON data for required fields, range checks, and data type checks to ensure that bad data does not make it into your database instance. These and other MySQL 8.,0 JSON features will be covered in this session.
