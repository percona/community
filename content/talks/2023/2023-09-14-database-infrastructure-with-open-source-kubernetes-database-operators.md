## Abstract

In this talk, we’ll explore how Kubernetes Operators are revolutionizing the way we manage and deploy database infrastructure in modern, cloud-native environments. During this session, we’ll delve into the key features and benefits of using open source Kubernetes database Operators, such as their ability to automate tasks like backup and recovery, scaling, and monitoring. We’ll also discuss how Operators provide a standardized approach to managing different types of databases, from traditional relational databases to newer NoSQL and cloud-native options.
