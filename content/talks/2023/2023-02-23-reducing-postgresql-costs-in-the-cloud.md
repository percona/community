## Abstract

In the face of economic uncertainty and a possible recession, many companies are trimming expenses, freezing hiring, and, in some cases, laying off staff.

But what if you could cut costs without negatively impacting resources or headcount? Better yet, what if you could free up enough budget to keep your existing staff and hire the quality candidates your team needs?

In this talk, Jobin Augustine, Percona's PostgreSQL Escalation Specialist, will walk you through tried-and-tested PostgreSQL cost-cutting strategies, all designed to make an immediate impact on your bottom line.
