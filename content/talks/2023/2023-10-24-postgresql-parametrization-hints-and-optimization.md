## Abstract

Is your PostgreSQL cluster underperforming even when running on a large server? Are you running with IO saturation? Is your memory under pressure? Is the CPU load too high? PostgreSQL was designed to run almost everywhere. That flexibility provided out of the box represents a challenge for those running PostgreSQL on large servers and intensive workloads. Finding the proper parametrization in your system could be challenging: it requires knowledge, continuous monitoring, and tuning according to the workload changes. This session will explore the essential aspects of PostgreSQL parametrization and OS-related parametrization. It will provide insights into what should be monitored and how to modify configurations accordingly. After completing this session, you can boost your PostgreSQL cluster performance, effectively and consistently.
