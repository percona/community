## Abstract

We will learn about the process of monitoring databases with a single open-source monitoring tool. We will analyze the data produced in customizable dashboards and identify the metrics that show us vulnerabilities in our databases wherever they are deployed. We'll look at ways to set up real-time alerts and get the most out of monitoring dashboards.

After this talk, attendees will gain fundamental knowledge about database monitoring; they will be able to install Percona Monitoring and Management, an open-source tool to obtain metrics from their databases. In addition, they will be able to quickly identify the essential components of the Grafana-based PMM user interface and will be able to generate their dashboards.
