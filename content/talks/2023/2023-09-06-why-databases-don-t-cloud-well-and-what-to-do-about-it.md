## Abstract

Containers are great for ephemeral applications where you do not need to save state. Databases, as a general rule, are not useful if ephemeral. So try to set up persistent storage for these databases, where you can ‘claim’ disk storage that is hopefully somewhat independent of the pod lifecycle.
