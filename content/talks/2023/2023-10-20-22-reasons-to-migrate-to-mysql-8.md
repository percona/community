## Abstract

MySQL 8 is different from previous major MySQL versions, because MySQL 8 in 2023 is significantly different from MySQL 8 initial release in 2018, because many features are introduced in the minor version released since. In this presentation we will look at those most important Modern MySQL 8 features which appeared since the initial MySQL 8 release.
