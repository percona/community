![an open source cloud native database](https://www.percona.com/community-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cloud-native-database-300x220.jpg)During our presentation at [Percona Live 2019](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/an-open-source-cloud-native-database-cndb) Intel and its software partners will introduce the audience to the work we’re doing to enable an open-source framework, we call Cloud Native Database. This is a collaborative effort between [Intel](https://intel.com/), [Rockset](https://rockset.com/), [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and [Percona](https://www.percona.com/). Through the presentation the audience will be introduced to a set of principles and architectural elements that define what we mean by Cloud Native Database. We will discuss Rockset’s RocksDB-Cloud library and how it works with Facebook’s MyRocks storage engine. We also will cover PlanetScale’s Vitess project and their use of Kubernetes for deployment of our Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) mechanisms. Lastly we share data on the performance and scale characteristics of the architecture and components that we have developed.

### Who'd get the most from the presentation?

Developers, DBAs, database practitioners in general, and folks interested in building/deploying/operating Stateful, Cloud Native Micro-Services on Kubernetes will all benefit from this presentation.

### Whose presentations are you most looking forward to?

I’m really looking forward to [Vitess: Running Sharded MySQL on Kubernetes](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/vitess-running-sharded-mysql-on-kubernetes) by Sugu Sougoumarane and Dan Kozlowski. The folks at PlanetScale are doing some amazing stuff with the Vitess project. I’m also super excited to get audience feedback on our second presentation, [A Discussion on the Advantages Afforded MySQL DBaaS offerings hosted on Intel's Next Gen Platform](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/a-discussion-on-the-advantages-afforded-mysql-dbaas-offerings-hosted-on-intels-next-gen-platform)**.** ![](https://www.percona.com/community-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Percona-Live-2019-300x167.png) -- Photo by [Michael Weidner](https://unsplash.com/photos/h-rP5KSC2W0?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/cloud?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)
