The topic I'm presenting addresses a growing and unfulfilled need: the ability to run stateful workloads in Kubernetes. Running stateless applications is now considered a solved problem. However, it's currently not practical to put databases like MySQL in containers, give them to Kubernetes, and expect it to manage their life cycles.

Vitess addresses this need by providing all the necessary orchestration and safety, and it has multiple years of mileage to show for it. Storage is the last piece of the puzzle that needs to be solved in Kubernetes, and it's exciting to see people look towards Vitess to fill this gap.

Who’d benefit most from the presentation?
-----------------------------------------

Anybody that's looking to move to Kubernetes and is wondering about what to do about their data is the perfect audience. Needless to say, vitess also addresses problems of scalability. So, those who are looking to scale mysql will also benefit from our talk.

Whose presentations are you most looking forward to?
----------------------------------------------------

I'm looking forward to _[An Open-Source, Cloud Native Database (CNDB)](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/an-open-source-cloud-native-database-cndb)_ by David Cohen, of Intel, and others. They are doing something unique by bridging the gap from legacy systems and cloud-based architectures that are coming up today, and using all open source technology. 

I'll be presenting my talk _[Vitess: Running Sharded MySQL on Kubernetes](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/vitess-running-sharded-mysql-on-kubernetes)_ at Percona Live 2019 on Wednesday, May 29 alongside Dan Kozlowski, also of [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).
