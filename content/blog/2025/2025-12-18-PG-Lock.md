Looking at software acquisitions, one might assume they only change logos. In reality, they often change roadmaps, priorities, and unfortunately all too often also the promises customers originally bought into.

I have experienced this more than once as a customer. Most recently, my team evaluated a product management tool that, shortly after being acquired, informed us we had a single month to migrate away. While I personally had not invested much time yet, colleagues had already moved documentation and workflows only to see that work become wasted effort. For those not familiar with product management, migrating all the product planning documentation is a huge effort and having it wasted is like erasing a month of your life.

One might say “business is business” and that customers can always take their money elsewhere. That may be true, but it does little to make customers feel safe or protected. In practice, it often leaves them confused about where accountability lies. Who should we blame when the original vendor no longer exists and the acquiring company is acting in its own strategic interest?

Unfortunately, I am now seeing similar patterns emerge in my professional focus area: PostgreSQL.

Don't get me wrong, PostgreSQL Community is driving an amazing database that has been and will be open source. That being said PostgreSQL is not only the database but a whole ecosystem. 

Over the past year, several important companies in the PostgreSQL ecosystem have been acquired. In recent prospective customer conversations, we increasingly hear from PostgreSQL users running mission-critical workloads on-premises who feel abandoned by their vendor. These organizations are being quietly nudged toward “modernization” paths that, in practice, resemble mandatory SaaS migration.

Having worked closely with MongoDB users for years, this pattern feels familiar. Since MongoDB Atlas became the primary strategic focus, many customers experienced similar pressure. What feels different in the PostgreSQL world is timing.

Teams often discover late in the renewal cycle that:
* Their on-prem PostgreSQL deployment is no longer strategic for the vendor
* Key components they depend on, which were never fully open source, are no longer available for renewal
* The implied options are to “move to the cloud” or rapidly find an alternative, even when migration planning is complicated by lack of source availability

This puts PostgreSQL customers in a difficult position:
accept architectural change under pressure, or scramble to replace a trusted vendor while the clock is already ticking.

While recent conversations often reference Crunchy Data following its acquisition by Snowflake, this is not about a single company. The broader pattern has repeated across the industry, including infrastructure significant projects involving MinIO, Bitnami, HashiCorp, and Redis.

This raises a fundamental question for the PostgreSQL ecosystem and infrastructure software in general:
> When a critical infrastructure vendor is acquired or changes licensing, who advocates for the customers that cannot move?

Open source is not just a licensing model or philosophical ideal. It provides freedom of choice, deployment flexibility, and risk mitigation. Recent community responses such as OpenTofu, OpenBao, and Valkey demonstrate a growing maturity and ability of open source communities to organize when freedoms erode.

It is disappointing to see similar dynamics affect PostgreSQL, a database often considered one of the most open source driven projects in the industry. When PostgreSQL derivatives are impacted, the shadow inevitably reaches upstream as well.

If this post reaches teams who were not yet aware of these shifts and gives them more time to plan, it serves its purpose. If you are running PostgreSQL in environments where SaaS is not an option, now is the time to ask difficult questions before renewal conversations start, not after options disappear.

# We Want to Hear from You
I am curious:
* Have you seen similar shifts in PostgreSQL vendors post-acquisition?
* What is preventing you from moving to PostgreSQL community builds or alternative support models?
