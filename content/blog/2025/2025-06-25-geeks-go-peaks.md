We believe this is something every strong team aspires to: taking interactions beyond the office, building a sense of community outside of work, and getting to know each other beyond job titles. That’s the kind of value people seek when they come to us.

People want to feel alive, to experience new sensations, to see the world from a different perspective - and share that journey with fellow enthusiasts.

## Join Our Adventure Community: Explore, Connect, Thrive

[The Geeks Go Peaks community](https://geeksgopeaks.com/) is all about bringing people together through unforgettable experiences. Whether you're seeking a relaxed getaway with your partner or craving the thrill of a high-altitude expedition, we've got events for every adventurer. From laid-back activities like quad biking or ice dipping to group micro-adventures such as SUP boarding in central Berlin, caving, or rock climbing, there's something for everyone. For the bold, we organize serious expeditions, including high-altitude mountain ascents. So far, we've summited nine peaks, each offering breathtaking views, and we're eyeing Mount Kazbek in Georgia and Thorong Peak in Nepal next.

## Our mission?

To build a vibrant community of explorers who value shared experiences and the discovery of the world's cultural and natural treasures. These adventures do more than just create memories - they spark lifelong friendships and expand your personal and professional networks. Through our events, people find their best friends and continue exploring the world together. It's a joy to bring such value to the world.

## Why the IT Community?

The IT industry is full of driven individuals who spend long hours behind screens. At some point, many realize they need more - more movement, more nature, more challenges. Outdoor activities like running, climbing, obstacle races, diving, or windsurfing not only boost physical health but also recharge mental well-being. IT professionals are often high-achievers, eager to push their limits, whether that's training for a marathon or summiting iconic peaks. We connect these like-minded adventurers, fostering a community where they can inspire and support each other.

## What We've Done

Our past events showcase the diversity of our adventures:

-   Aconcagua, Argentina: A grueling climb to nearly 7,000 meters rewarded us with jaw-dropping views and a profound sense of achievement. "Aconcagua was the trip of a lifetime. I'd recommend it to anyone in good shape and hungry for a challenge. You won't regret it!"

-   Caving in Budapest: An underground world surprised even locals, proving adventure is often closer than you think. "I'm from Hungary and never explored the caves before. Doing it with GGP was the perfect way to finally change that - I absolutely loved it!"

-   Rock Climbing in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada: First-timers conquered the walls, forging bonds while cheering each other on. "I couldn't have asked for a better first climbing adventure. The group, the views - everything was awesome."

-   Northern Lights in Lapland: Snowy forests and vibrant skies created magical nights and dreams of future trips. "This wasn't my first GGP trip - we're practically family now. It was magic seeing the lights every single day."

-   Via Ferrata in the Dolomites, Italy; a descent through Vallée Blanche in France; local events with paddleboarding and rock climbing in North Carolina... and that's just the beginning. We already have so much planned for this year and the next!

## Upcoming Adventures

Our calendar is brimming with thrilling plans. In August, we'll tackle the exhilarating ascent of Mount Kazbek. Then we're off to hike under the midnight sun in [Svalbard](https://geeksgopeaks.com/midnight_sun_hike_longyearbyen_august_2025), an awe-inspiring land where untouched Arctic nature reigns and polar bears outnumber people.

We'll ride the wild waters of[ the Gully River](https://geeksgopeaks.com/gully_river_rafting_rafting_the_dam_release) during dam release season, set sail on catamarans through the British Virgin Islands in February, and explore wintertime Alaska with freeride skiing, glacier ice climbing, and evenings in a Nordic sauna.

And that's just the beginning - Nepal, Bolivia, the Grand Canyon, the volcanoes of Vanuatu, Peru, and so much more are waiting.

For those in the USA, we've got local adventures like Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim hikes, quick one- and two-day hikes, paddleboarding and kayaking, cycling, fishing and yachting, rock climbing, and even diving. And events tied to conferences such as Re:Invent, ATO Raleigh, All Things Open RTP, and Mountain Data & Dev Conference in Utah.

And this fall, on September 21, we're hosting a women's charity run - [CODE PINK RUN](https://geeksgopeaks.com/codepinkrun2025)! All proceeds will go to the Pretty In Pink Foundation to support women in their fight against breast cancer. Join us! We'd love to see everyone at this celebration of female solidarity!
