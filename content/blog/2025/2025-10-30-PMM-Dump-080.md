The `pmm-dump` client utility performs a logical backup of the performance metrics collected by the PMM Server and imports them into a different PMM Server instance. PMM Dump allows you to share monitoring data collected by your PMM server with the Percona Support team securely.

Up until now dumps, created by the tool, were not encrypted. It was possible to encrypt them after they are done but this required additional actions from the user.

Starting from the upcoming PMM Dump version 0.8.0-ga released on October 29, 2025, dumps are encrypted by default.

## Key points

- Dump files are encrypted by default with AES-256-based encryption.
- An auto-generated password is produced for each encrypted dump; it is printed at the end of the export operation or can be written to a file with `--pass-filepath`.
- You can provide a custom password with `--pass`.
- Disable encryption with `--no-encryption` only when you understand the risks.
- By default, for encrypted dumps, export logging to STDOUT is suppressed; use `--no-just-key` to override.

## Why this matters

Encrypting PMM dumps prevents accidental exposure of monitoring and query data that may contain sensitive information (query text, hostnames, metrics). It brings PMM Dump in line with secure data-handling best practices and simplifies safe sharing with Percona Support.

## Quick examples

Export (encryption enabled by default):

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ pmm-dump export --pmm-url='https://admin:admin@127.0.0.1' --allow-insecure-certs
... 
Password: ****************
$ ls pmm-dump-<TIMESTAMP>.tar.gz.enc
```

Provide a custom password:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ pmm-dump export --pmm-url='https://admin:admin@127.0.0.1' --pass='My$trongP@ss'
```

Save auto-generated password to file:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ pmm-dump export --pmm-url='https://admin:admin@127.0.0.1' --pass-filepath=/tmp/pmm-dump.pass
```

Disable encryption (not recommended):

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ pmm-dump export --pmm-url='https://admin:admin@127.0.0.1' --no-encryption
```

Import an encrypted dump:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ pmm-dump import --pmm-url='https://admin:admin@127.0.0.1' --allow-insecure-certs \
--dump-path=pmm-dump-1758017090.tar.gz.enc --pass='My$trongP@ss'
```

Decrypt an encrypted dump (if needed):

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ openssl enc -d -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -in dump.tar.gz.enc -out dump.tar.gz
```

## Recommendations

- Prefer leaving encryption enabled.
- Use `--pass-filepath` to store passwords securely rather than relying on terminal output.
- Transfer encrypted archives over secure channels (SCP/SFTP) and share passwords via secure out-of-band channels.

## Availability

Encryption support is included starting in the recent PMM Dump 0.8.0-ga release. Check your PMM Dump version (`pmm-dump version`) and the docs for exact version details.
