At Percona, we believe that great open source software is built *with* the Community, not just *for* it. As we plan the next iteration of ~[pg_stat_monitor](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor)~, our advanced PostgreSQL monitoring extension, weâ€™re taking a closer look at the current feature set and how it aligns with real-world usage.
![](blog/2025/08/jan-ask_not_PostgreSQL.png)
Over time, pg_stat_monitor has grown beyond its initial query performance monitoring scope. While many features have proven to be extremely useful (especially in use with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)), others may see limited adoption or give no evidence of any adoption at all. To ensure we're investing in what really matters, we want to understand what you, the users and contributors, actually rely on day-to-day.
Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re kicking off a Community feedback phase.
Weâ€™re especially interested in:
* What features of pg_stat_monitor are critical for your workflows?
* Are you using it together with PMM, CLI or in another way?
* Are there parts of the extension that feel unnecessary or unclear?
* What would you love to see in the next release?

This is just the beginning of a broader review and improvement effort, one that we want to run transparently and inclusively, true to our open source values.
Whether you're a developer, DBA, or platform engineer using pg_stat_monitor directly or via tools like PMM, know that your input matters.

Letâ€™s shape the future of pg_stat_monitor together.
