Hello everyone! We are indeed excited to announce that the new release of VictoriaMetrics has many exciting features, one of them being [downsampling](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling).

Downsampling helps to reduce disk space usage and improves query performance in a big and long time series if applied independently per each time series. However, this feature works only with a large number of samples per series.

As we are keen on implementing downsampling in our future releases, we would like to understand how long you keep your metrics in PMM. Please go to the [Poll](https://forums.percona.com/t/how-long-do-you-keep-the-metrics-in-pmm/14236) page and provide your inputs.

We appreciate your help. Thank You!
