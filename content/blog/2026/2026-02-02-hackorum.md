Last year at pgconf.dev, there was a discussion about improving the user interface for the PostgreSQL hackers mailing list, which is the main communication channel for PostgreSQL core development. Based on that discussion, I want to share a small project we have been working on:

[https://hackorum.dev/](https://hackorum.dev/)

Hackorum provides a **read-only (for now)** web view of the mailing list with a more forum-like presentation. It is a **work-in-progress proof of concept**, and we are primarily looking for feedback on whether this approach is useful and what we should improve next.

## What Hackorum already does

Hackorum focuses on readability, navigation, and workflow improvements for people who follow pg-hackers. Some highlights:

* **Continuous mailing list synchronization**: The site is subscribed to the list
* **Commitfest integration**: See commitfest context next to threads - you directly know what's the state of this commit/thread. 
* **User profiles**: Contributor/committer status from the main website
* **Statistics**: Per-user and mailing lists insights
* **Easy download of attached patches**: Including helper script for easy rebase and merge
* **Additional logged-in user features**: Per-message read status, starring threads, tags, notes, mentions on messages and threads
* **Basic team support**: Shared reading status, shared mentioned tags and notes - mention someone underneath an email an the person gets notified 
* **Resend email**: Integration from the official archive
* **Importing read status / tags via CSV files**: To help migration from email-based workflows

## What we plan next

* **Sending emails from the web UI**: Initially via Gmail API for Google-authenticated users who authorize sending
* **Advanced search functionality**
* **Integrating other mailing lists**
