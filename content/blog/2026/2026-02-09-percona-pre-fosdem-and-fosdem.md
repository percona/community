This is a recap of Percona at preFosdem and Fosdem!

![Fosdem intro](/blog/2026/02/fosdem-all.png)

Before FOSDEM officially started, the database community gathered for MySQL Belgium Days (Pre-FOSDEM), a two-day event bringing together MySQL developers, DBAs, engineers, tool builders, and open-source enthusiasts. It was an excellent space for deep technical discussions, knowledge sharing, and reconnecting with the community, hosted by the amazing **Frederic Descamps**.
The event featured strong participation from **Percona** and the wider MySQL ecosystem, with talks led by **Peter Zaitsev, Marco Tusa, Fernando Laudares Camargos, Arunjith Aravindan, Vinicius Grippa, Pep Pla, and Yura Sorokin**.

Also, in Belgium same week, several other events took place, including **PGDay-FOSDEM**, **MariaDB Day**, and the **MySQL Summit**.

At **PGDay**, it was a pleasure to see the PostgreSQL community together; we had several participants representing us.

## FOSDEM 2026, Percona booth

At the Percona booth, conversations focused on open-source databases and Kubernetes, including [OpenEverest’s](https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest) first-ever presence at FOSDEM. Around 40 Perconians were present, a great chance to finally meet many colleagues in person. As always, we had many visitors, and it was great to see that many already knew about Percona, while others were eager to learn more and explore what we do in the world of Open Source!
