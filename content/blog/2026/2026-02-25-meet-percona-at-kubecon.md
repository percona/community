The Percona team is heading to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Amsterdam, and we'd love to meet you in person!

You can find us at **Booth 790**. This is a great chance to talk with engineers working on Percona Operators.

We will be there to discuss:
- Running MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB on Kubernetes
- Production-ready HA setups
- Backup and PITR strategies
- Multi-cluster and multi-region deployments
- Operators roadmap and upcoming features
- Real-world troubleshooting stories

If you're running Percona Operators in production (or just getting started), we'd love to hear your feedback and learn about your challenges.

If you're just curious (or even suspicious) about running databases on Kubernetes, we'd love to talk and answer your questions.
