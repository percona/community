## The Evolution

Since its inception in June 2014, **Kubernetes** has dramatically transformed container orchestration, revolutionizing the management and scaling of applications. To mark its tenth anniversary, the [Data on Kubernetes Community (DoKC)](https://dok.community/) released an infographic showcasing key milestones and community contributions to the evolution of operators for managing stateful applications. This project was made possible by the collaboration of DoKC members **Edith Puclla, Sergey Pronin, Robert Hodges, Gabriele Bartolini, Chris Malarky, Mark Kember, Paul Au, and Luciano Stabel**.

Explore the infographic to see how Kubernetes has shaped the future of database management on Kubernetes.

## Adoption and Impact

The [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) says that 84% of organizations are using or considering Kubernetes, with 70% running stateful applications on it in production. The number of users and containers has grown, showing that more people are contributing, adopting cloud-native technologies, and finding new ways to use Kubernetes to manage stateful applications.

## Looking Ahead

As we celebrate ten years of Kubernetes, the way databases are integrated keeps improving, thanks to community efforts and new technology. **Percona Everest is an excellent example of this progress**. It’s more than just a tool for databases; it represents the future of running databases on Kubernetes. It's open-source and makes running any database on cloud-based Kubernetes clusters easy. If you want to try it, visit our [Percona Everest GitHub Repository](https://github.com/percona/everest) and give us a star if you like it.
