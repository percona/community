Last week, I participated as a speaker for the first time at Community Over Code 2024.

## Community Over Code

[Community Over Code](https://communityovercode.org/) is a key principle at Apache, highlighting the importance of having a solid and collaborative community rather than just focusing on the code. While good code is essential, the community's strength and resilience keep a project going and growing. I love how this is expressed in the "Apache Way."

Renaming ApacheCon to "Community Over Code" reflects this idea, emphasizing the central role of community in Apache's approach. This year, [Community Over Code was in Bratislava, Slovakia.](https://eu.communityovercode.org/)
My talk was in the Community track, where I spoke about [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Internship, [the Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/), and [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). My goal was to celebrate the success of the Outreachy program, which has surpassed 1,000 internships, and I am proud to be one of them.

I talked about the community, shared success stories, and provided clear examples, such as [Bowrna Prabhakaran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowrna/) and [Ephraim Anierobi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ephraimanierobi/), and shared my personal experience. I also explained how Outreachy, along with my mentors from Apache Airflow, [Jarek Potiuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarekpotiuk/), and [Elad Kalif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elad-kalif-811b4887/), boosted my professional career in Open Source 03 years ago.

## Working at Percona

Now I work for Percona, which has been recognized as one of [Inc. Magazineâ€™s 2024 Best Workplaces](https://www.inc.com/profile/percona)! I love my job and the amazing things we are building at Percona.
[Percona](https://www.percona.com/) is an open-source software company that fully believes that open source should remain open throughout. This belief inspires me to work at Percona.
