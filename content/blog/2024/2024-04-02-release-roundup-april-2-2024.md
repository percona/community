-   Fixed tracking memory usage in SharedBufferFragment to prevent out of memory issues in the WiredTiger storage engine.
-   Added an index on the process field for the `config.locks` collection to ensure update operations on it are completed even in heavy loaded deployments.

## Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.4.1

On March 25, 2024, [Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.4.1](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/release-notes/2.4.1.html) was released. It is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring those backups to a specific point in time.

This release fixes the issue of failing incremental backups. It was caused by the backup metadata document reaching the maximum size limit of 16MB. The issue is fixed by introducing the new approach to handling the metadatada document: it no longer contains the list of backup files which is now stored separately on the storage and is read by PBM on demand. The new metadata handling approach applies to physical, incremental, and snapshot-based backups.
