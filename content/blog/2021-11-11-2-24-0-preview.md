## 2.24.0 Preview Release

Percona Monitoring and Management 2.24.0 is now available as a Preview Release.

PMM team really appreciates your feedback!

We encourage you to try this PMM Preview Release in **testing environments** only, as these packages and images are not fully production-ready. The final version is expected to be released through the standard channels in the coming week.
