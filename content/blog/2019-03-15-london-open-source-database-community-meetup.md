I strongly believe in the community. 

Communities are the real strength of open source. Not just the theoretical ability to study, modify and share code – but the fact that other people out there are doing these things. Creating a base of knowledge and a network of relations.These can become work relationships, valuable discussions, open source tools, or even friendships.

That is why, when I heard that several people from the Percona support team will soon be in London, I badly wanted to organise an event. 

Actually, there was an interesting coincidence. When I asked [Sveta Smirnova](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/sveta-smirnova/) if anyone from Percona lives in London, I already knew I wanted to organise an event with this new meetup group I’ve started: [London Open Source Database meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-Open-Source-Database-Meetup/). But when Sveta told me that a whole team of Perconians would soon come to London? Well, trying to organise something big was natural! I asked them to speak about a broad range of technologies. And they came up with some brilliant talk descriptions. 

This is the list of talks (the order may change a bit):

*   **MongoDB ReplicaSet and Sharding** – Vinodh Krishnaswamy, Support Engineer
*   **MySQL 8.0 architecture and Enhancements** – Lalit Choudhary, Bug Reproduction Analyst
*   **Optimizer Histograms: When they Help and When Do Not?** – Sveta Smirnova, Principal Bug Escalation Specialist
*   **New and Maturing Built-in Features in PostgreSQL to Help Build Simple Shards** – Jobin Augustine, Senior Support Engineer
*   **Brothers in Arms: Using ProxySQL + PXC to Ensure Transparent High Availability for your Application** – Vinicius Grippa, Support Engineer
