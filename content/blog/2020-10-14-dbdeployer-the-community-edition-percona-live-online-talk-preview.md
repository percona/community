_[Percona Live Online Agenda](https://www.percona.com/live/agenda) Slot: Wed 21 Oct • New York 3:30 a.m. • London 8:30 a.m. • New Delhi 1:00 p.m. • Singapore 3:30 p.m._

### Abstract

[DBdeployer](https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer), an open source tool that allows easy deployment of many MySQL/Percona servers in the same host, has passed two years of development. Its latest additions have aimed at improving ease of use for both beginners and experts. This talk will show how to start with dbdeployer with an empty box, and quickly populate it with recent and less recent server versions, all at the command line.

### Why is your talk exciting?

This talk is a celebration of collaboration in the community. I will present recent features that were requested, or suggested, by the community. I will also show how those suggestions came to fruition, to encourage more of the same from attendees.

### Who would benefit the most from your talk?

Any current or future user of dbdeployer. They will see the process of refining the usability of the tool through interaction with the community.

### Is there any other question you would like to answer?

There is a recurring question that I get from people who are about to use dbdeployer but haven't gotten to know it well: "is it cloud friendly?" It pains me to answer that it isn't, not because of a deficiency of the tool, but because it was designed to stay out of the cloud. Using dbdeployer, the cloud is your laptop, or the tiny Linux server in your workroom. The main purpose of dbdeployer is to enable developers, support engineers, QA engineers, database administrators, to have on demand deployments of MySQL always, even when there is no connection with the cloud or when you want something faster than the cloud.

### What other talks are you most looking forward to?

Most of the talks and keynote are promising. I look forward in particular to watch "[Vitess Online Schema Migration Automation](https://sched.co/ePp6)" by Shlomi Noach and "[MySQL 8.0 Document Store - Discovery of a New World](https://sched.co/ePpc)" by Frédéric Descamps.
