It's all about MongoDB® 4.2 this time. MongoDB 4.2 released like a month ago (still newborn) and I am going to cover what's new in three different areas: sharding, indexing, and the aggregation framework. I can promise you this, there are a lot of new features and improvements in MongoDB 4.2 and I am thrilled to present those to you. Join me at [Percona Live Europe](https://www.percona.com/live-agenda), and discover how distributed transactions, wildcard indexes and materialized views (plus many other new features) actually work and fit on your workload.

This talk is for you if...
--------------------------

... you are actively working with MongoDB, either as a DBA/SRE or a Developer. I am confident that you will love the new features and you would like to adopt them straight away after the presentation. 

If you are not working with MongoDB or you have never heard about MongoDB before, come join us and check if the 4.2 new features fit your needs. Maybe MongoDB 4.2 has the answer to a challenge you are currently facing with your existing datastore.

Other presentations I'm looking forward to...
---------------------------------------------

I wish I could be James Arthur Madrox (the Multiple Man) and attend all talks. I am going to attend all MongoDB related talks, as all the Mongo topics are great this year. I will also try to attend as many Postgres talks as I can, I am very curious to find out how the Percona distribution for Postgres will make my DBA life easier. Keynotes and tutorials are also a must. 

And last but not least, Percona Europe returns to [Amsterdam](https://www.percona.com/live-info)!!!
