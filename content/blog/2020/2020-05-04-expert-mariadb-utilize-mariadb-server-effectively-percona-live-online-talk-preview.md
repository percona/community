_[Percona Live Online](https://www.percona.com/live/conferences) Agenda Slot:  Tue 19 May • New York_ _11:00 p.m. • London 4:00 a.m. (Wed) • New Delhi 8:30 a.m. (Wed)_ _Level: Intermediate_

### Abstract

MariaDB Server 10.4 has been out for some time now (June 2019) and it has many new features, some of which MySQL does not have. Feature-wise, it is important to know what MariaDB Server 10.4 has (e.g. system tables in the Aria storage engine, ability to reload SSL certificates without a restart and more!) and what it lacks compared to MySQL 8.0 (group replication, the X Protocol, etc.)  Attendees will become more knowledgeable about how to better manage, observe, and secure their MariaDB Servers.

### Why is Your Talk Exciting?

I am going to talk about MariaDB Server from a user perspective and why you might consider using this fork of MySQL for your production use cases. After all, it has progressed differently from MySQL and has features that are similar, sometimes implemented differently, yet it also has new features that MySQL may not get to, e.g. Oracle compatibility. 

It is also likely that we can talk a little about MariaDB Server 10.5 which should be just around the corner, as it is currently in beta. There are plenty of improvements around JSON, more information reported in the threadpool, a new Amazon S3 storage engine, plenty of InnoDB improvements, Galera 4 inconsistency voting, and more.

### Who Would Benefit the Most From Your Talk?

Are you MariaDB curious? You would enjoy this talk as it is will only cover features not already present in MySQL. After all, it doesn’t matter how things are implemented — this is totally from a user perspective, so if you’re already used to MySQL, find out what \*else\* you will get from MariaDB Server.

### What Other Presentations Are You Most Looking Forward To?

I’m interested in the ProxySQL talks, though [the entire agenda](https://www.percona.com/live/percona-live-online-full-agenda) is great.
