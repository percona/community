### Why is your talk exciting?

I'm not sure if my talk is exciting, but I'm quite positive the subject is! Vitess has been gaining a lot of traction over the past few years and I must admit that I've been keen to get hands-on experience with it for years. As we, MessageBird, encounter rapid growth standard (read) scaling wasn't applicable anymore and we were in need for a solution. Late 2019 we implemented our (quick) DIY sharding solution based upon existing components. A few months later we encountered the next scaling issue and we found our own built solution wasn't suitable in this case. That's when we considered investing our time instead in a Vitess proof of concept (community edition) and this talk will compare the two paths chosen and show some of the choices and compromises you have to make.

### Who would benefit the most from your talk?

People who need to shard their (write) workloads and are considering using Vitess for this purpose. Our intention is to do a fair comparison between the two to help others make a well prepared decision.

### What other presentations are you most looking forward to?

The agenda is full of presentations I'm looking forward to. However as my current world is dominated by productionalising Vitess, I will be looking forward to [Shlomi Noach's talk](https://perconaliveonline2020.sched.com/event/ePp6/vitess-online-schema-migration-automation) about online schema migrations automation in Vitess.
