I love the Raspberry Pi, and I love Percona server. The combination of the two
can provide a nice home database. I have been running a Percona Server database
since 2019 to hold all the weather information. That I collect from several
of my Weather Stations.

I did a my first blog post on installing Percona Server 5.7 on the Raspberry
Pi 3+.

You can read that blog post here:
[How to Build a Percona Server "Stack" on a Raspberry Pi 3+](https://percona.community/blog/2019/08/01/how-to-build-a-percona-server-stack-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/)

Fast forward to 2022 and we now have the resources to build Percona Server 8.0
on the Raspberry Pi 4. In this post I will cover building and installing
Percona Server 8.0.27 and Percona XtraBackup 8.0.27.

**One Warning!** The builds will take sometime.

Prereqs:

1. Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB or 8GB model.
2. 128GB or 256GB microSD card. Of course you can go bigger.

I won't cover installing Raspbian Bullseye, you can follow the steps here:
[Install Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye on Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrytips.com/install-raspbian-raspberry-pi/)

## The Builds
You will need to install these additional packages listed below:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install build-essential bison pkg-config cmake devscripts debconf debhelper \
automake bison ca-certificates libcurl4-gnutls-dev cmake libaio-dev \
libncurses-devlibssl-dev libtool libz-dev libgcrypt-dev \
libev-dev lsb-release python-docutils build-essential rsync libdbd-mysql-perl \
libnuma1 socat librtmp-dev libtinfo5 qpress liblz4-tool liblz4-1 liblz4-dev
```
Let's download Percona Server and some additional tools.

```
$ wget https://downloads.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-LATEST/Percona-Server-8.0.27-18/source/tarball/percona-server-8.0.27-18.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf percona-server-8.0.27-18.tar.gz
wget https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.78.0/source/boost_1_78_0.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf boost_1_78_0.tar.gz
$ https://downloads.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraBackup-LATEST/Percona-XtraBackup-8.0.27-19/source/tarball/percona-xtrabackup-8.0.27-19.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf percona-xtrabackup-8.0.27-19.tar.gz
```

## Build Percona Server
At the time of writing 8.0.27-18 is the current version.
```
$ cd percona-server-8.0.27-18
$ cmake -DFORCE_INSOURCE_BUILD=1 -DWITH_BOOST=$HOME/boost_1_78_0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/mysql .
$ sudo make -j1
$ sudo make install
```
You will notice that I used make -j1 above. I found that when using make -j2 or -j3
that the Raspberry Pi 4 would be come unresponsive around 80% into the build. So dropping to
-j1 took the build a little longer and complete.

 ## Build XtraBackup
 At the time of writing 8.0.27-19 is the current version.
 ```
 $ cd percona-xtrabackup-8.0.27-19
 $ cmake -DFORCE_INSOURCE_BUILD=1 -DWITH_BOOST=$HOME/boost_1_78_0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/xtraback .
 $ sudo make -j1
 $ sudo make install
 ```
Once again I had to use -j1 for the build. Took longer to build but it completed.
The builds are now complete. Since we created everything from source they are a
few last things that need to be done.

We need to create the mysql user and set its home directory. We need to update
the /usr/local/mysql to be owned by mysql.
```
$ sudo useradd mysql -d /usr/local/mysql
$ sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /usr/local/mysql
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/log/mysql
$ sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/log/mysql
```
One last thing we need before to start MySQL for the 1st time is an /etc/my.cnf.
Here is a sample you can work with.
```
$ sudo vi /etc/my.cnf
```
Copy and paste the contents below into your my.cnf.
```
[mysqld]
character-set-server = utf8mb4
port = 3306
socket = /usr/local/mysql/mysql.sock
pid-file = /usr/local/mysql/mysqld.pid
basedir = /usr/local/mysql
datadir = /data0/mysql/data
tmpdir  = /data0/mysql/tmp
general_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql-general.log
log-error = /var/log/mysql/mysqld.log
slow_query_log_file =/var/log/mysql/slow_query.log
slow_query_log = 0 # Slow query log off
expire_logs_days = 5
log_error_verbosity = 1
lower_case_table_names = 1
max_allowed_packet = 32M
max_connections = 50
max_user_connections = 40
skip-external-locking
skip-name-resolve
table_open_cache=500
thread_cache_size=16
open_files_limit=1000
table_open_cache=1000

innodb_data_home_dir = /data0/mysql/data
innodb_log_group_home_dir = /data0/mysql/data
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2048M
innodb_log_files_in_group = 2
innodb_log_file_size = 128M
innodb_log_buffer_size = 16M
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2
innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 50
innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
innodb_file_per_table = 1
innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 2
thread_pool_size=16
```
You will want to set the following setting to match your needs.

1. datadir =
2. innodb_data_home_dir = **this should match your datadir**
3. innodb_log_group_home_dir = **this should match your datadir**

Now you will want to create a mysqld.server service file in /lib/systemd/system
```
$ sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service
```
Add the below contents to your mysqld.service.
```
[Unit]
Description=Percona Server 8.0
After=syslog.target
After=network.target
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
[Service]
User=mysql
Group=mysql
ExecStart=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/etc/my.cnf
TimeoutSec=300
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/mysql
Restart=on-failure
#RestartPreventExitStatus=1
PrivateTmp=true
```
Let's setup Percona Server to stop and start with the OS.
```
$ sudo systemctl enable mysqld.Service
```
## Finish your build.
Once you have completed all the above steps. You can follow this blog post
[The lost art of Database Server Initialization.](https://percona.community/blog/2021/09/06/lost-art-of-database-server-initialization/). Start at step 4.

Thats it. You have a new Percona Server 8.0 running on your Raspberry Pi 4.
This process does take some patients, but if you like the Raspberry Pi and
Percona Server this is well worth the time it takes.

## Now for some screen shots.
