### Abstract

Kunlun Distributed Database Cluster is a distributed DBMS that aims to combine the best of both MySQL and PostgreSQL for a highly performant, highly available, highly scalable and fault-tolerant, easy to use and manage database system that requires minimal human maintenance.  It enables users to define table sharding rules so that it automatically distributes tables properly to available storage shards; implements the two-phase commit protocol to do distributed transaction commit; uses MySQL group replication for high availability in storage shards; fixes a series of MySQL XA bugs to make distributed transactions highly reliable, among many other enhancements.

### Why is your talk exciting?

Audience will get to know Kunlun — a brand new distributed database cluster built from two most popular open source database systems — MySQL and PostgreSQL, and how Kunlun can make developers and DBAs’ life much easier. They will also know why it’s troublesome and error prone to use MySQL group replication as is and how Kunlun make it totally easy by hiding all the complexity.

### Who would benefit the most from your talk?

Application developers and DBAs who use MySQL and/or PostgreSQL clusters, especially those having to deal with multi terabytes of relational data that no single db instance can manage.

### What other presentations are you most looking forward to?

Those about alternative ways to deal with ever growing and multi terabytes of relational data which far exceeds the capacity of a single db instance.
