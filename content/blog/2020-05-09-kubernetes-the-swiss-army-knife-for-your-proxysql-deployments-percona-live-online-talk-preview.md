_Percona Live Online Agenda Slot: Tue 19 May • New York 10:00 p.m. • London 3:00 a.m. (Wed) • New Delhi 7:30 a.m. (Wed)_

### Abstract

ProxySQL is a high performance proxy from design to implementation. It speaks the MySQL protocol, and can go beyond load balancing. This talk covers various deployment options for ProxySQL in a Kubernetes environment. 

Typically ProxySQL is deployed in one of three ways depending on the scale and needs of your environment: 

- Directly on each application server 
- On a separate server (or layer) 
- Cascaded, i.e. on each application server as well as a separate server (or layer) 

This talk will cover how to successfully implement each of these ProxySQL deployment methods in Kubernetes using a highly scalable and robust approach.

### Why is your talk exciting?

This was originally meant to be a tutorial, but it is now a talk, so it is not 3 hours cut into one, but tailored to whet your appetites for what is possible with ProxySQL on Kubernetes, which is an important topic in the community. I will share practical examples of deployment methods that have been implemented successfully in collaboration with large scale users.

### Who would benefit the most from your talk?

You should have an intermediate understanding of MySQL and how replication and proxying would work as well as at least a basic understanding of Kubernetes.

### What other presentations are you most looking forward to?

All the talks on the [Percona Live agenda](https://www.percona.com/live/percona-live-online-full-agenda) are exciting, but if I had to pick one talk, it would be “Mostly Mistaken and Ignored Parameters While Optimizing a PostgreSQL Database” by Avi Vallarapu.
