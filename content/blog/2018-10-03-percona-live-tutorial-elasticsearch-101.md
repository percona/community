For [Percona Live Europe](https://www.percona.com/live/e18/), I'll be presenting the tutorial [_Elasticsearch 101_](https://www.percona.com/live/e18/sessions/elasticsearch-101) alongside my colleagues and fellow presenters from [ObjectRocket](https://www.objectrocket.com/) **Alex Cercel**, DBA, and **Mihai Aldoiu**, Data Engineer. Here's a brief overview of our tutorial. 

[**Elasticsearch®**](https://www.elastic.co/) is well known as a highly scalable search engine that stores data in a structure optimized for language based searches but its capabilities and use cases don’t stop there. In this tutorial, we’ll give you a hands-on introduction to Elasticsearch and give you a glimpse at some of the fundamental concepts. We'll cover various administrative topics like installation and configuration, Cluster/Node management, indexes management and monitoring cluster health. We will also look at developer-oriented topics like mappings and analysis, aggregations and schema design that will help you build a robust application. There will be lab sessions too - bring a laptop! 

**Why's it exciting?** Well, although my main focus is on MongoDB, I am a huge fan of polyglot persistence. I start dealing with Elasticsearch, like, a year ago to overcome some MongoDB hard limits, and I must admit I entered a whole new world. Before working with Elasticsearch I was under the misconception "_it's for full-text search only_". The truth is that the product offers way more than that. I am looking forward to sharing my experience through this presentation. 

Alex and Mihai are senior Elasticsearch data engineers who'll share their deep knowledge and expertise with the attendees.

Who would get the most from this talk?
--------------------------------------

Well, everyone _could_ benefit but if I wanted to make it a little bit more specific those with most to gain are:

*   those who know nothing about Elasticsearch or you fall under the same misconception as I did :)
*   someone who wants to start a new project and consider Elasticsearch as an option
*   if you are already dealing with Elasticsearch and you want to develop more knowledge of its operations and internals.
*   those running Elasticsearch in production and you are facing any type of challenge

What presentations am I most looking forward to?
------------------------------------------------

At Percona conferences, I wish I was [Jamie Madrox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Madrox). I wish I could create "dupes" of myself and attend every presentation. I will try to attend all MongoDB related talks since it's my primary focus. However, this year I will also watch out for postgres-related talks. Postgres made huge steps forward since the last time I worked with it—it's become "hot" again in the database world.
