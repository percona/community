### Abstract

The amount of data collected by applications nowadays is growing at a scary pace. Many of them need to handle billions of users generating and consuming data at an incredible speed. Maybe you are wondering how to create an application like this? What is required? What works best for your project? In this session we'll compare popular Java and JVM persistence frameworks for NoSQL databases: Spring Data, Micronaut Data, Hibernate OGM, Jakarta NoSQL, and GORM. How do they compare, what are the strengths, weaknesses, differences, and similarities? We'll show each of them with a selection of different NoSQL database systems (Key-Value, Document, Column, Graph).

### Why is your talk exciting?

The data load on applications has increased exponentially in recent years. We know the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can cope with heavy loads very well yet we often come across the big dilemma: there are tons of persistence frameworks out there but which one performs best for my case? It would normally take ages to evaluate and choose the best fit for your use case. We've done those comparisons for you.

### Who would benefit the most from your talk?

Those who make technical roadmap decisions such as software architects, engineering managers, and developers involved in new technology decisions.

### What other talks are you most looking forward to?

The conference agenda is simply amazing. It's difficult to choose which sessions to attend, but we're pretty sure we'll attend "[The 411 PMM](https://sched.co/ePlw)" by Brandon Fleisher and Steve Hoffman, and also "[How Can Databases Capitalize on Computational Storage](https://sched.co/eN9q)" by Tong Zhang and JB Baker.
