![Barton Springs, Austin](https://www.percona.com/community-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Barton_Springs_Austin-300x225.jpg) I am stoked for [Percona Live 2019](https://www.percona.com/live/19/) in Austin, Texas. As a long-standing Texas resident, I always call out Austin as THE spot to visit.  Amazing experiences at [Barton Springs Pool](https://www.facebook.com/BartonSpringsPool/) (right), Congress Bridge Bat Colony, South Congress night life, 6th street bars, Rainey Street, and more within just a few kilometers. Big-time foodie culture, great breweries/distilleries combined with cool people and technology should make this an amazing conference. I will be presenting [Tips and Tricks with MariaDB ColumnStore](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/tips-and-tricks-with-mariadb-columnstore), a technology I helped create as CTO of [InfiniDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniDB). The talk will use examples from ColumnStore (also known as AX ,part of MariaDB X3) but many of the concepts can be applied to other columnar engines.

#### Who'd get the most from this talk?

*   Anyone interested in learning about columnar engines and how they work
*   Any current users of columnar analytic engines interested in optimizing performance

#### How do you know if you should be interested in a columnar storage engine?

*   You have queries that involve millions, billions, or trillions of rows under analysis
*   Heavy workloads with summarization/analysis/aggregation, often for visualization
*   You want ad-hoc analytics (no new engineering for new analytic questions)
*   Data ingestion takes too long, or analytic queries take too long

#### Personally, I'm looking forward to...

[Self-Driving Databases](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/self-driving-databases-it-all-starts-with-workload-forecasting) talk from Lin Ma at CME, the [Clickhouse Features](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/clickhouse-features-to-blow-your-mind) talk from Aleksei Milovidov, and Jeremy Cole’s [talk on Cloud challenges](https://www.percona.com/live/19/sessions/mysql-on-google-cloud-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly).  Plus Barton Springs, Rainey Street, and visiting Austin .☺ \[caption id="attachment\_637" align="aligncenter" width="800"\]![Jim Tommaney but not in Texas...](https://www.percona.com/community-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jim-Great-Wall.jpg) Jim Tommaney but not in Texas...\[/caption\]
