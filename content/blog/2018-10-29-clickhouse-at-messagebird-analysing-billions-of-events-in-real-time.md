[![MessageBird Logo](blog/2018/10/message-bird.png)](https://www.messagebird.com/en)

We'll look into how Clickhouse allows us to ingest a large amount of data and run complex analytical interactive queries atÂ [MessageBird](https://www.messagebird.com/en). We also present the business needs that brought ClickHouse to our attention and detail the journey to its deployment. We cover the problems we faced, and how we dealt with them. We talk about our current Cloud production setup and how we deployed and use it. 

We are really enthusiastic to share a use case of Clickhouse, how it helped us to scale our analytics stack with the good, the bad and the ugly. 

The talk could be useful to newcomers and everyone wondering if Clickhouse could be useful to them.

### What we're looking forward to...

There are many talks, but these are among the top ones we're looking forward to in particular:

*   [A Year in Google Cloud](https://www.percona.com/live/e18/sessions/a-year-in-google-cloud)
*   [Advanced Features of ClickHouse](https://www.percona.com/live/e18/sessions/advanced-features-of-clickhouse)
