_[Percona Live Online](https://www.percona.com/live/agenda) Agenda Slot: Wed 21 Aug • New York 12:00 midnight • London 05:00 a.m. • New Delhi 9:30 a.m. • Singapore 12:00 noon_

### Abstract

I want to help DBAs and Support engineers find out what's really going on when some problem strikes.  My goal is to show new ways to diagnose problems now available in MariaDB 10.5.   See [the full abstract](https://perconaliveonline2020.sched.com/event/ePoK/mariadb-105-new-features-for-troubleshooting) for more.

### Why Is Your Talk Exciting?

It provides a lot of details and practical examples of how MariaDB 10.5 new features for troubleshooting may help DBAs and developers in understanding the production load and tuning MariaDB server for it. The process of documenting these new features is not completed yet, so you may not be able to easily find the information presented elsewhere.

### Who Would Benefit From Your Talk?

DBAs and consultants who use or plan to use MariaDB server 10.5 in production.

### What Is the Most Useful New Feature in MariaDB 10.5?

For me it's memory instrumentation. There are alternative ways to find memory leaks or trace memory allocations in detail, but they either have notable performance impacts or are hard to implement in production. This feature potentially can bring DBAs many insights and help to resolve nasty problems. I've missed it for years.

### What Other Talks Are You Most Looking Forward To?

For me these presentations look really interesting:

*   [MySQL Ecosystem on ARM By Krunal Bauskar & Mike Grayson](https://perconaliveonline2020.sched.com/event/ePnR/mysql-ecosystem-on-arm?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=no&bg=no)
    *   I think ARM is a future for servers and historically I was always interested in MySQL implementations on non-x86 hardware.
*   [Vitess Online Schema Migration Automation By Shlomi Noach & Evgeniy Patlan](https://perconaliveonline2020.sched.com/event/ePp6/vitess-online-schema-migration-automation?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=no&bg=no)
    *   Whatever Shlomi speaks about, it's always interesting and useful!
