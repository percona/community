There is an old saying that what looks like a duck and quacks like a duck is probably a duck.  But what looks like MongoDB and acts like MongoDB could be FerretDB! To greatly simplify the technology behind this project, FerretDB speaks, or quacks, MongoDB but stores the data in PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL has had a rich JSON data environment for years and FerrtDB takes advantage of this capability. This is a truly Open Source MongoDB alternative and was released under the Apache 2.0 license.

FerretDB has been in development for a while, but they [announced](https://blog.ferretdb.io/ferretdb-1-0-ga-opensource-mongodb-alternative/) the first Generally Available Release of their product recently. 

In the announcement is a quick "How To Get Started" section which details how to get FerretDB running with the help of Docker.  As can be seen below, this is a very simple process.

```
$  docker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one

```

Now that FerretDB is ready, we can use the MondoDB shell to speak to it.  

```
$ docker exec -it ferretdb mongosh
```

```
Current Mongosh Log ID: 6435963392d12db06bdb7ecc
Connecting to:      mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+1.8.0

(the remaining output was omitted for brevity)
```

Entering some very basic MongoDB commands work as expected. Well, for the most part. 

```
test> db
test
test> show collections;

test> db.createCollection('test');
{ ok: 1 }
test> show collections;
test
```
```
test> db.test.insert({name: "Dave", state: "Texas"});
DeprecationWarning: Collection.insert() is deprecated. Use insertOne, insertMany, or bulkWrite.
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedIds: { '0': ObjectId("6435ac52c4a22ac27f30e2a2") }
}
test> db.test.insertOne({name: "Dave", state: "Texas"});
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId("6435ac5dc4a22ac27f30e2a3")
}
test> db.test.find();
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("6435ac52c4a22ac27f30e2a2"),
    name: 'Dave',
    state: 'Texas'
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("6435ac5dc4a22ac27f30e2a3"),
    name: 'Dave',
    state: 'Texas'
  }
]
test> 
```

I expected that the inset on the deprecated ’insert’ command would not create a document but I was wrong.  It took me a moment to realize that the ‘insert’ and ‘insertOne’ commands both worked after looking at the different ObjectIds. 
But what do we know about the server itself? Issuing a serverStatus commands confirms we are talking to the FerretDB server. 

```
test> db.runCommand({serverStatus: 1});
{
  host: '58f00a86bad1',
  version: '6.0.42',
  process: 'ferretdb',
  pid: Long("10"),
  uptime: 6277.435694035,
  uptimeMillis: Long("6277435"),
  uptimeEstimate: Long("6277"),
  localTime: ISODate("2023-04-11T18:59:46.488Z"),
  freeMonitoring: { state: 'undecided' },
  metrics: {
    commands: {
      ping: { total: Long("1"), failed: Long("0") },
      getFreeMonitoringStatus: { total: Long("1"), failed: Long("0") },

      hello: { total: Long("1"), failed: Long("0") },
      unknown: { total: Long("5"), failed: Long("0") }
    }
  },
  ok: 1,
  catalogStats: {
    collections: 210,
    capped: 0,
    timeseries: 0,
    views: 0,
    internalCollections: 0,
    internalViews: 0
  }
}
test> 
```

## Summary
    
FerretDB is a MongoDB protocol server built upon PostgreSQL. Those unhappy with the change in MongoDB’s license change away from open source now have another path they can follow. I will have a full session at [Percona Live](https://www.percona.com/live/conferences) on [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.io/) where I will delve into how complete of an option this is for those desiring an open solution.
