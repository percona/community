There is still time to [register](https://mariadb.org/fest-registration/) for the MariaDB Server Fest 2020!

![MariaDB Fest 2020](blog/2020/09/mariadb_fest_video.jpeg) MariaDB Fest 2020[/caption]

Our Fest is the opportunity to have live interactions with the key players on MariaDB Server: the developers of MariaDB Server, the service providers, the experts, the system integrators, and – perhaps most importantly – your fellow users!

Interactivity happens all the time, with the presenters being cloned and available for answering questions throughout the presentation. This is because the presentations (including voice, a talking head, and the slide decks) are pre-recorded, freeing up the presenter’s attention to be fully devoted to the audience. Multithreading!

Sessions are listed in full on the [web](https://mariadb.org/fest2020-sessions), with the exact timing for the three virtual locations still being fine-tuned. Turn in to listen to 30 presenters from eg. Supermetrics, MariaDB Corporation, Percona, Microsoft, Galera, Tencent, Bilibili and MariaDB Foundation.

Timing is during your day-time, and spread out across three days, five hours a day, so you can still get most of your normal job done.

On Monday-Wednesday 14-16 Sep 2020 we have the Paris conference, on Tuesday-Thursday 15-17 Sep 2020 we have the New York conference, and on Friday-Sunday 18-20 Sep 2020 the Beijing conference. Exact agendas vary slightly between the locations, to cater to the sleeping patterns of the presenters from other time zones.

Talk to you in less than two weeks!
