## Start monitoring today, help build tomorrow

Looking for an easier way to monitor and troubleshoot your databases? **PMM is a free, open-source solution** designed for exactly that. It supports multiple database technologies (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB) and lets you view and monitor them all in one place.  

We encourage you to try PMM, share your experience, and help us make it better with your feedback!  

Be part of the Percona community: submit a PR, leave a review, report a bug, or help others in the forum. Every contribution matters and helps keep open source software free and accessible to all!

## Ask questions and get answers

Have questions or need guidance? Visit our [Community Forum](https://forums.percona.com/c/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm/30/none), where you can get help from other Percona users and experienced experts.

Itâ€™s also a great place to give back: share your knowledge, answer questions, and connect with others. Every contribution helps strengthen the community and keeps it growing.

## Help others choose: Leave an honest review

Not a developer? You can still make a big impact by leaving an unbiased review of Percona software on popular app marketplaces.

If PMM or other Percona tools have worked well for you, your recommendation can help others make informed decisions and discover the right solution for their needs.

You could mention the operating system, CPU, memory, volumes of data, engines, programming languages, applications, versions, configurations, performance, etc.  

Your review not only helps us improve but can also make a real difference for someone evaluating PMM in a production environment.

## Which databases can PMM monitor?

PMM is fully open source. This means that you can monitor your databases and contribute to the software itself, as well as have the freedom to extend its capabilities and build your own tooling around it.

Out of the box, PMM provides a rich set of exporters to collect and expose metrics, including:

* MongoDB Exporter
* MySQL Server Exporter
* Node Exporter
* ProxySQL Server Exporter
* Amazon RDS Exporter

For a deeper look at how these exporters fit into the system, see [PMM Architecture](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/architecture.html).

If you'd like to get involved, we welcome contributions! Check out our [Contributing guide](/contribute) and explore the [main PMM repository](https://github.com/percona/pmm), which also lists all our exporter repositories.
