Percona Everest is an open source private Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) that's in development. Percona Everest's goal is to help developers deploy code faster, scale deployments rapidly, and reduce database administration overhead while regaining control over their data, database configuration, and DBaaS costs. Try Percona Everest in action and help us to drive it forward. Want to help with Percona Everest's development? Check out some of the ways you can contribute.

## Percona Everest Components 

We encourage you to install, try, build, share, and contribute code to Percona Everest and its components.

Percona Everest App is an application with a web interface. It consists of two major components:

* Percona Everest Frontend is a frontend application developed using the Bit framework, React library and TypeScript language.

* Percona Everest Backend is the backend API that processes requests from the frontend app and sends them to the Kubernetes API. It is developed in Golang using the Echo framework. 

Percona Everest App is an application in a container ready to run in Kubernetes or Docker. It requires a PostgreSQL database and a public Kuberentes Cluster.

Percona Everest CLI (everestctl) is a console tool used to provision and install Percona Everest operators and components to your Kubernetes Cluster where Percona Everest will create and manage database clusters. Everestctl is developed in Golang language and it is as a built executable file.

Also, Percona Everest uses:

* Everest Operator that relies on underlying Percona Kubernetes Operators for deploying DB clusters of a given engine type.

* Everest Catalog - an internal tool for everestcli.
