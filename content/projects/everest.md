**Percona Everest** is an open source private database-as-a-service that helps developers deploy code faster, scale deployments rapidly, and database admins - reduce database administration overhead while regaining control over their data, database configuration, and DBaaS costs.

**Percona Everest** is designed for those who want to break free from vendor lock-in, ensure optimal database performance, enable cost-effective and right-sized database deployments, and reduce database administration overhead.

Percona Everest is currently in **Alpha**. We look for early adopters and contributors to drive it forward - we need your feedback to improve the software.

## Percona Everest Architecture

Percona Everest App is an application with a web interface. It consists of two major components:

* [Percona Everest Frontend](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-frontend) is a frontend application developed using the Vite framework, React library and TypeScript language.

* [Percona Everest Backend](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-backend) is the backend API that processes requests from the frontend app and sends them to the Kubernetes API. It is developed in Golang using the Echo framework. 

[Percona Everest CLI (everestctl)](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-cli) is a console tool used to provision and install Percona Everest operators and components to your Kubernetes Cluster where Percona Everest will create and manage database clusters. Everestctl is developed in Golang language, and it is as a built executable file.

Also, Percona Everest uses:

* Everest Operator that rely on underlying operators for deploying DB clusters of a given engine type.

* Everest Catalog - an internal tool for everestcli.
