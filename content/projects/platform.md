## What is Percona Platform? 

Percona Platform provides a unified database experience that includes open source solutions, support, services, training, and automatic insights for your database environments. [Percona Platform](https://portal.percona.com/) brings together distributions of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB alongside a range of open source tools for data backup, availability, and management.

It also includes [Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)](percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) for database management, monitoring, and automated insights, making it easier to manage database deployments.

## Prerequisites

To start using Percona Platform, you need to:
* install the latest version of Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM). Outgoing internet access is required for PMM.
* enable the telemetry to access intelligence features, like Percona Advisors
