The Percona distributions for MySQL come in two flavors - one is based on MySQL and one is based on [XtraDB Cluster](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtradb-cluster). Percona XtraDB Cluster ensures maximum availability with stability and synchronous replication - while being and staying open source.

## When do I need the Percona Distribution for MySQL and when the Distribution with XtraDB Cluster?

For single node source/replica deployments or high availability through group replication in your typical MySQL environment, Percona Distribution for MySQL is the standard choice. If you're looking for high availability through Galera, the Percona Distribution based on [XtraDB Cluster](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtradb-cluster) will be your download of choice.
