Contributing to the MongoDb community is not just about coding or providing new enhancements. Often the most valuable contributions are not code, they come in the form of bug reports, feedback, testing betaâ€™s and of course giving back your experience to the community through blogs, videos, and other mechanisms. If you are willing to help, let us know! We are always looking for great content to help make the MongoDB community even better. Share your experiences though a guide or tutorial with us and get a free hat! 

Percona is committed to helping the MongoDB community grow and learn. Over the last year the team at Percona has written over 60 MongoDB articles geared toward educating and teaching what we learned as we helped our customers. Those posts have been viewed over 100,000 times. In addition, we have also helped deliver, build, or give a platform for over 125 hours of conference talks, videos, and training specifically geared towards MongoDB (many available for free on youtube right now!).  

Here to learn about MongoDB? Check out some of the great free content below we have contributed to the ecosystem or that have been delivered as part of our conferences!  When the MongoDB community grows, we all benefit!
