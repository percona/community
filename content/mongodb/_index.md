## Download, Try, Give Feedback, &  Enhance:

Welcome to Percona’s Community Page for MongoDB! Percona offers free educational materials, how tos, guides, and free software around MongoDB! We believe in keeping MongoDB and its critical features open and accessible to all. We offer a Distribution of MongoDB that takes the best parts of the MongoDB community, adds in features and enhancements from the community (as well as from Percona’s own engineers), and merges it together in a single package giving you an enhanced version of MongoDB Community that provides features, fixes, and tools generally only available for a fee as part of MongoDB Enterprise. We would love your help in making this project better whether it is via feedback, bug reports, content, or code contributions. How can you help?
