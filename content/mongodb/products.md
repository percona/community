With a flexible schema, natural high availability, and built-in horizontal scaling, MongoDB has often been considered the best big data solution among general-purpose databases.

MongoDB Community Edition is at the core of Percona Distribution for MongoDB. It automatically includes features such as native high availability, distributed transactions, a flexible data schema, and the familiarity of JSON documents.

Percona Distribution for MongoDB doesn't stop there! The Percona Memory Engine in-memory storage engine, HashiCorp Vault integration, data-at-rest encryption, audit logging, external LDAP authentication with SASL, and hot backups, combine to deliver a complete package that maximizes performance and streamlines database efficiencies.
