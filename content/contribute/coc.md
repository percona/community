# Percona Community Code of Conduct

The Percona Community is dedicated to developing, installing, running, optimizing, and learning everything regarding databases and the infrastructure that supports them. To ensure this community remains a welcoming and productive space, we have established the following standards.

## The Percona Ethos: The ABCs

Before diving into the formal details, our community runs on three core principles:

* **A - Assume Good Intentions:** We approach interactions with the belief that everyone is here to learn and contribute positively.
* **B - Be Nice to Each Other:** Being civil, respectful, and empathetic goes a long way.
* **C - Critique Code, Not People:** We offer constructive feedback on code, tools, and ideas—never on people or their personalities.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment:** Public or private harassment, including the use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
* **Attacks:** Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* **Doxing:** Publishing others' private information, such as a physical address, without their explicit permission.
* **Spam:** Unsolicited advertising, link farming, or repetitive disruptive content.
* **Disruption:** Any malicious activity intended to cause technical degradation or disrupt community dialogue.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies across all community spaces (GitHub, Jira, Slack, Forums, Events) and to individuals who publicly represent the community in online and offline spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.  
**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity on the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and in external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Contact & Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by emailing **[community-team@percona.com](mailto:community-team@percona.com)**.

* **Responsiveness:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report and respond within 48 hours.
* **Confidentiality:** All reports will be handled with discretion. We will respect the privacy and security of the reporter.
* **Recusal:** If a report involves a specific member of the community team, they will be recused from handling your report to ensure a fair process.
