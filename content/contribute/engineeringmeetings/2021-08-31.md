## Agenda

1. **Reverting Percona's `node_exporter` to Prometheus'**

    We'll share how to revert back PMM's `node_exporter` to the Prometheus original...and why we want to.

    [Carlos](https://github.com/percona-csalguero) will be going deep inside the code, rummaging through the innards of the Golang code, seeing how the exporter works, making changes, and giving step-by-step commentary.

    He'll be working in these repos:

    - <https://github.com/percona/node_exporter>
    - <https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter>

2. **Difference between PMM and community dashboards**

    [Vadim](https://github.com/adivinho) will show us how PMM's dashboards differ from community ones, and what it means.

3. **How to use newly-created dashboards migration scripts**

    [Vadim](https://github.com/adivinho) will also show us how to easily migrate dashboards.
