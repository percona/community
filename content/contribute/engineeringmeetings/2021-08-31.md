## What?

We're share how to revert back PMM's `node_exporter` to the Prometheus original...and why we want to.

[Carlos](https://github.com/percona-csalguero) will be going deep inside the code, rummaging through the innards of the Golang code, seeing how the exporter works, making changes, and giving step-by-step commentary.

He'll be working in these repos:

- <https://github.com/percona/node_exporter>
- <https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter>

## Who?

- PMM coders and commentators
