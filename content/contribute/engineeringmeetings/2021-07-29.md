## What?

We're talking about Prometheus ***exporters***:

- How they work
- Who uses them and why
- Where they're used
- What you can and can't do with them

So, basically *anything* to do with Prometheus exporters.

## Who?

Come along if you're a:

- User of Prometheus exporters (standalone or within PMM)
- Student of Prometheus exporters (and want to learn how to code/tweak them)
- Potential user of Prometheus exporters (what can they do)
- DBA thinking about Prometheus exporters (getting metrics data out of databases)
- DBA dreaming about Prometheus exporters (thinking about the same)
- ... you get the idea

## Who else?

- PMM devs
- PMM Prometheus experts 
 
...on hand to teach, explain and demonstrate.

## When?

At the next PMM community meeting, July 29.

## Why?

To grow a vibrant and engaging community.

To learn about you and what you need.

Tell us about this meeting:

- What DID you like?
- What DIDN'T you like? (Be honest!)
- What do you want to see next time?

Or just ask us something.

Really, anything.

Go on. Don't be shy. ☺️

This is YOUR community, after all.
