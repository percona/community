## What's this for?

Wonderful things are coming to PMM â€“ we can't hold our excitement any longer.

Now's the time to get involved with our blossoming PMM community:

- meet the team behind PMM;
- learn how other people are using PMM;
- see previews of new features and tell us what you think IN REAL TIME!

Or, maybe we'll just have some fun and a chat...

## Who's this for?

- Users of PMM
- Students of PMM
- Potential users of PMM
- DBAs thinking about PMM
- DBAs dreaming about PMM
- Anyone who doesn't know what PMM is (shame on you!)

(So, that's basically ANYONE.)

## Details

TBA.

## Feedback and Q&A

- What DID you like?
- What DIDN'T you like? (Be honest!)
- What do you want to see next time?
- Ask us a question. Really, anything. Go on. Don't be shy. This is YOUR community, after all.
