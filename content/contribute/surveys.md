One of the things we could really use your help on is providing us with feedback on how we are doing and what Percona can do to improve its database products.  

If you use Percona software and want to help us to make it better, tell us your user story by completing this [simple survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-L_kApti3sEI97YsLjpU0mi9bNVQBeF2awBeZ7W-sWA/edit). It is short and will take no more than 5-8 minutes of your time.

Want to share your feedback on a particular product? We have put together a few short surveys for each one of our main products (supporting MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Percona Monitoring and Management, and our Kubernetes Operators).  Each survey consists of quick 5-7 questions and should take no more than a minute or two to complete.

* [Percona Server for MySQL & PXC](https://per.co.na/lnsTqM)
* [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://per.co.na/7BGhFe)
* [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://per.co.na/1KfvRt)
* [Percona Monitoring and Management](https://per.co.na/JQ7yAt)
* [Percona Operators (Either for PG, MYSQL, or MongoDB)](https://per.co.na/Gxwcrj)

Note, everyone who fills in the survey is eligible to be part of a drawing for a Percona T-Shirt. 10 people will randomly be selected. You donâ€™t have to leave an email when you fill out the survey, but you do to be entered into the drawing.

Thank you for helping us out!
