All of Percona's software is open source, which means we accept and value contributions. We also know that open source is more than code, so we emphasize all kinds of contributions, including:

- [Writing a blog post](/blog/2022/02/10/how-to-publish-blog-post/)
- Answering questions on the [Percona Forum](https://forums.percona.com/)
- Creating a video tutorial or giving a talk on how to use Percona software
- [Contributing to documentation](/contribute/documentation)
- Submitting and helping close bug reports 

Ready to join the ranks of contributors? 

On this page we have a few ideas but don't feel limited to what's listed here. We also like to reward contributors from time to time with Percona swag and other tokens of our gratitude.
