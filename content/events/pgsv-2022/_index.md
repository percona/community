This time Percona Team flew to San Jose to participate in the [Postgres Conference Silicon Valley](https://postgresconf.org/conferences/SV2022) from April 7th to 8th. This is a significant event for the Postgres Community on the West Coast. 

Percona sponsored the event on the Gold level and had a huge presence there. 4 recognized database experts gave 5 stunning talks:

* [PostgreSQL Replication Conflicts: Avoiding Pitfalls](https://postgresconf.org/conferences/SV2022/program/proposals/postgresql-replication-conflicts-avoiding-pitfalls) by Hamid Akhtar (Technical Product Manager for PostgreSQL);
* [Tune PostgreSQL for Read/Write Scalability](https://postgresconf.org/conferences/SV2022/program/proposals/tune-postgresql-for-read-write-scalability) and [A Deep Dive into PostgreSQL Indexing](https://postgresconf.org/conferences/SV2022/program/proposals/a-deep-dive-into-postgresql-indexing-563e1a79-a2f8-4fa3-8208-31cb030bd07e) by Ibrar Ahmed (Senior Software Architect);
* [How Users Will Dictate and Change the Next 20 Years of PostgreSQL](https://postgresconf.org/conferences/SV2022/program/proposals/postgresql-performance-tuning-8c2c185e-23b3-44f8-aa22-294616a0c2fb) by Matt Yonkovit (Head of Open Source Strategy);
* [PL/Java - Extend the Power of Your Database](https://postgresconf.org/conferences/SV2022/program/proposals/pl-java-extend-the-power-of-your-database) by Charly Batista (PostgreSQL Tech Lead).

As sponsors, we had a wonderful opportunity to welcome the community members to our booth. We had plenty of swag to give out to the attendees: flasks, stickers, pens, and so forth. No one left it without a gift!

Our best-of-breed engineers were there to answer any questions attendees might have. Everyone could come and chat about Postgres, the latest database trends, and database monitoring options and play with the Yonk box! They are good, aren't they?

What is the Yonk box? It is an arcade controller built by Matt Yonkovit, the HOSS. It allows you to manage database workloads in real-time and play with them in [Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management). If you want to see it in action, watch the video of the [live-streamed PMM meetup](https://percona.community/events/percona-meetups/percona-meetup-for-pmm-october-2021/) from the last year's [OSS (Open Source Summit)](https://percona.community/events/open-source-summit-seattle-2021/) in Seattle with the demo. And for those who decide to replicate it or build their own version, Matt shared the code on his [GitHub](https://github.com/TheYonk/os-db-json-tester).

Also, Matt and Charly live-streamed a bi-weekly community meetup for Postgres directly from the event. The topic was [Setting Up and Scheduling Regular PostgreSQL Backups](http://percona.community/events/streams-pg/2022-04-08-setting-up-and-scheduling-regular-postgresql-backups/). Watch its [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OeX-gsdwFc)!

Percona Team spent a fantastic time together. The good tradition is to go for a team dinner to chat. These moments are so valuable nowadays!
