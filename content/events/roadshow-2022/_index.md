**Breakout session #1 - Open Source Databases in the Cloud-Native Landscape - how-to, the pros, and the consequences, 45 min, Michal Nosek**

It's not uncommon to deploy a microservice-based, containerized application on Kubernetes these days. How to deploy a database in such a situation? In this presentation, we will present a viable alternative for any application running on Kubernetes - using free and open-source Percona Kubernetes Operators for MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
 
**Breakout session #2 - Efficient Monitoring and Management of Database Infrastructure Using PMM, 45 min, Dimitri Vanoverbeke**

Want to demystify the impact of your workload on your database infrastructure, understand performance indicators and have centralized management of backups. Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free, open-source monitoring and management tool for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and underlying components. This talk will provide you with common use cases, capabilities and recommendations in using this Percona solution.

**Breakout session #3 - Percona Platform, 45 min, Holman Romero**

**Breakout session #4 - Different Shades of Technology Lock-In: What Your Sales Rep Doesn’t Tell You, 20 min, Michal Nosek and Dimitri Vanoverbeke**

Technology lock-in comes in different flavors: vendor lock-in, platform lock-in, architecture lock-in, emotional lock-in… you can’t avoid all of them at the same time. Let’s take a look at what being locked in actually means and how open-source software helps to avoid some of the pitfalls in the database world.
