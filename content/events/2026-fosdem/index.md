Percona had a strong presence at **FOSDEM 2026**, taking place January 31 – February 1, 2026, at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. 

Percona experts contributed to the technical schedule with the following accepted talk:

* **PostgreSQL and MySQL, Two Databases, Three Perspectives** by Pep Pla (January 31, 2026).

Beyond the individual sessions, Percona played a leading role in the conference program. The team hosted the **Database Dev Room** on Saturday, January 31, and led the **Community Dev Room** on Sunday, February 1, contributing talks, discussions, and hands-on engagement throughout the weekend.

Percona was also proud to be the **official coffee sponsor**, keeping the thousands of attendees energized! The Percona stand was located at **Building K, Stand K1-B-02**, where attendees could meet with experts to talk about open source databases, Kubernetes, and the latest in IT infrastructure.

A key highlight of the Percona booth is the access to leadership and deep technical expertise. Attendees had the opportunity to connect one-on-one with Perconians on-site, including Founder **Peter Zaitsev** and CEO **Peter Farkas**. Whether discussing services, solutions, or broader community initiatives, the team was eager to share insights and be part of the unique FOSDEM atmosphere.
