Backup is very important to reconstruct your database when loss occurs. Percona Xtrabackup is a combination of xtrabackup and innobackupex and can back up data from InnoDB, XtraDB and MyISAM tables. Our Community Meetup for MySQL in November will be hosted by Matt Yonkovit, The Head of Open Source Strategy (HOSS) at Percona with participation of Marcelo Altmann, MySQL Software Engineer at Percona and Pep Pla, Consultant at Percona. We will talk about backup during 1-hour live streaming and answer questions right away.
