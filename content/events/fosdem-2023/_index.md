FOSDEM is very special: people from all over the world come to Brussels to participate in the biggest open source event in Europe. How many people? FOSDEM attracts more than 5000 attendees to the ULB Solbosch campus.

Many open source projects have stands at the event that are provided to them free of charge by the organizers. It is a perfect opportunity not only to collect some swag with the logo of your favorite project, but also to chat with its representatives and maybe even core developers and ask your questions in person.

This year, PostgreSQL, MariaDB Server, Grafana, Ansible, Ubuntu, GitLab, Jenkins, and many other of our favorite projects were accepted to have a stand.

And Peter wasn’t the only Perconian who presented during the event. Percona’s Technical Evangelist Edith Puclla talked about [Exploring Database Containers](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/container_database_containers/) and [Monitor Your databases With Open Source Tools](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/db/). Many people came to hear her, the room was almost full.

Dmitry Kostiuk told everyone how to [draw your Kubernetes cluster the right way](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/container_kubernetes_cluster_right_way/) and how not to scare people. There were 400 attendees in the room!

Vinicius Grippa and Dmitry Lenev participated in MariaDB, MySQL and Friends devroom with talks about [Using New Generated Invisible Primary Key Feature in MySQL 8.0](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/mysql_gipk/) and [Extended Observability to Agentless Monitoring on MySQL Using ProcFS UDF Plugin](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/mysql_procfs_udf/).

Also, I, Aleks Abramova, talked about [Nurturing, Motivating and Recognizing None Code Contributions](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/nurture_motivate_recognise_noncode_contributions/).

To my mind, the most important part of every event is networking.  FOSDEM has so many great opportunities for you to get acquainted with new people, chat with old community friends and finally meet your remote colleagues in-person!

Traditionally, the Percona Team gathers together for a team dinner. We also invited some of our ex-colleagues who happened to be at FOSDEM - Matt Yonkovit, Sergey Kuzmichev, Alkin Tezuysal.

We also walked around the city to see the sights of charming Brussels. Did you know that Belgium is the birthplace of the smurfs? It was really a surprise for me.
