This summer Percona Team traveled to Belgrade in Serbia to participate in 2 events - Highload++ Serbia 2023 and Percona University Belgrade. 

The journey started with team building for those who arrived early. They went to a segway tour around the city and visited Belgrade Fortress with Kalemegdan park with an amazing guide who told them a lot about Serbia history. They also ride segways in the city center to get acquainted with the main tourist attractions. Belgrade is an amazing town with unique architecture. It was conquered and ruined so many times and then rebuilt again.

Highload was organized in the Metropol Hotel in the city center. The venue was big enough to accommodate 600 attendees.

Percona booth was located perfectly and was visible to attendees. Many people stopped by to learn more about Percona support and software. They watched the demo of PMM (Percona Monitoring and Management) and asked questions. It was so nice to meet so many interesting people and talk to them!
