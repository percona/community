## Academic Collaboration: Curriculum Modernization

Evgeniy is also involved in a strategic initiative led by the Chernihiv IT Cluster to support university faculty in updating and adapting their courses:

- DevOps — currently being adapted for academic use  
- Databases — under review for improvements and potential translation into English  
- Algorithms & Data Structures — being adapted by Yura Sorokin ([blog](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/yura-sorokin/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yura-v-sorokin/))

These efforts aim to help educators integrate modern technologies and open-source practices into their teaching. Once finalized, the team plans to publish a blog post sharing their experience and outcomes.
