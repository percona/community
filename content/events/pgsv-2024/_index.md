Our team of top-tier engineers was eagerly present to address any inquiries attendees might bring forth. Attendees were excited to join in. Anyone could stop by our booth and pick up some cool Percona gifts. It was a chance for everyone to have fun and get something special.

On the evenings, the Percona team usually gathered for a team dinner. Meeting face-to-face every now and then is really important when you work remotely!
