Percona team participated in the HighLoad ++ Spring conference in Moscow on May 17-18, 2021. It is the most famous IT conference in Russia for developers of highload projects. This year it brought together 2000 participants offline and 2000 online running 8 parallel tracks and having 20+ company stands for networking.

On the conference, Percona speakers presented 4 talks:
*   MySQL 8 Observability and Query Analysis with PMM by Peter Zaitsev (CEO)
*   Comparison of Kubernetes Operators for MySQL by Sergey Pronin (Product Owner)
*   Migrations between schemas and updates in MySQL: mechanisms, locks, loads by Nikolay Ihalainen (Senior Support Engineer)
*   Anatomy of a Kubernetes Operator for a database by Peter Zaitsev and Sergey Pronin.

Also, Vladimir Fedorov (Ecompay) invited Sveta Smirnova to become a co-speaker in the talk “How to Kill MySQL Correctly and Reliably”.

Percona also presented its software products at a stand where we held a PMM demo and some expert sessions on Kubernetes and pg_stat_monitor, offered a win-win lottery, and chatted with attendees about databases, open source software, remote work and so forth.

Our stand was located perfectly and attracted many attendees. Each of them could participate in a win-win lottery and pull a piece of paper out of the aquarium to receive a gift: T-shirts, tote bags, mugs, bottles, stickers, bracelets. 

We also had amazing, beautifly published Percona Anniversary Books to distribute. This book was published to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of Percona and contain many fascinating information about its history and values.
