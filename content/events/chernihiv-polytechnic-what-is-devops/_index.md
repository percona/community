Percona’s Evgeniy Patlan (Manager, Build & Release Engineering) and Serhii Stasiuk (Build/Release Engineer) participated in an online public meetup “What is DevOps?” for students of Chernihiv Polytechnic National University. Together with Volodymyr Rudiy (CEO, Agilevision.io) and Volodymyr Bazilevich (Academic, Chernihiv Polytechnic National University), they discussed the modern views on DevOps methodology, practices and people who do this job nowadays, tasks and challenges that they face and what is expected of them on the modern labor market. 

Students had an opportunity to learn the difference between DevOps and DevSecOps, what is CI/CD and if it truly exists, if DevOps can replace the QA engineers in the future with integrated auto-tests, and if we can (and should!) automate everything.

Watch the video to learn about those things and a lot of other trends in the DevOps world.
