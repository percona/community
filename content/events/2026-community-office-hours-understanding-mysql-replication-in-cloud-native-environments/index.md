🕒 **Time:** 14:00 GMT  
🎥 **Platforms:** LinkedIn Live & YouTube Live (links TBA) 

## What’s This Session About?

We’ll walk through the release and what it means for the community, with a focus on replication models, high availability, and practical guidance for running MySQL on Kubernetes.

## Key Topics We’ll Cover

- What MySQL Group Replication looks like in a cloud-native environment  
- How the Percona Operator for MySQL enables synchronous and asynchronous replication  
- Differences between replication models and when to use each  
- How this complements the existing Percona XtraDB Cluster Operator (PXC)  
- Practical considerations for MySQL high availability on Kubernetes  
- What the new GA release brings for the community
