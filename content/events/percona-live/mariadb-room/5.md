Vicențiu Ciorbaru - MariaDB Foundation - Percona Live 2021 - MariaDB Track Room

MariaDB has had ColumnStore (a columnar storage engine) available for a while now. The problem was that ColumnStore (formerly known as InniDB) was coded in such a way that required a custom version of MariaDB to function. The installation was also non-trivial, with quite a set of dependencies needed.
After a significant amount of work, both within MariaDB's codebase and ColumnStore's codebase, it is now possible with MariaDB 10.5 to simply load the ColumnStore plugin and run CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE=ColumnStore.
In this talk we will do an overview of the state of ColumnStore in MariaDB, discuss use cases as well as cover some implementation details to better understand performance implications when using ColumnStore.
