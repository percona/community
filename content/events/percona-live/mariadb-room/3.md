MariaDB has had JSON support for a while now. Released initially in 10.2, MariaDB tries to follow the SQL standard as close as possible. One of the new additions coming to MariaDB 10.6 is support for JSON_TABLE. In this talk we will go through the details of this new feature, as well use cases and interactions with JSON path. We will also compare MariaDB's implementation to other databases, so that you are aware of pitfalls if a migration is due. On the topic of migration, MariaDB has also introduced a data type plugin that understands MySQL's binary JSON format and coverts it to MariaDB's text based representation, without needing to do a full dump and restore.
