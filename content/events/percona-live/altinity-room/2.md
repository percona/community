Alexey Milovidov - Yandex - Percona Live ONLINE 2021 - Altinity Community Track

In 2021 the ClickHouse community is shipping the features that you probably always dreamed of. We are eliminating previously known limitations of ClickHouse. I will tell you and show demos about: replication without ZooKeeper; semistructured data; processing of frequent small INSERTs; support for transactions; window functions and projections and more and more... We're really excited about these features and hope they will make ClickHouse even better for your analytic applications.
