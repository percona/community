Stephen Borg - Matthew Formosa - Percona Live 2021 - Altinity Community Track

With such a saturated market for the iGaming industry, many technology providers are reviewing their architecture to provide a leaner, more sustainable platform. Complex architectures that involve heavy license and high maintenance costs were two of the rules to avoid when GiG kicked o R&D on what technology to choose at the heart of GiG Data. Tied with the necessity of good governance whilst empowering stakeholders needing real-time data, the list of databases became shorter and shorter.

With no vendor-locking and costly licenses ClickHouse came out a winner at being the best candidate for any business looking to host an on premise realtime database for analytics. Stephen and Matthew will be elaborating on how ClickHouse 2 of 5 Speakers became the database of choice.
