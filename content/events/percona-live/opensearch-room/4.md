Kyle Davis - AWS - Percona Live 2021

Flat earthers need not attend! This session will go through the basics of geospatial data in general, then go deeper on how it works in (and inside of) OpenSearch. The session will explain how to get geospatial information into OpenSearch, then how to query and visualize the data.
