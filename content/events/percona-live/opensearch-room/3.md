Kyle Davis - AWS - Percona Live 2021

OpenSearch has a strong set of security features but not everyone takes advantage of them. This session will provide an overview of the features as well as show ways to apply these features for real world problems. The session will include demos of data masking, authentication, and authorization, as well as index, document, and eld level security.
