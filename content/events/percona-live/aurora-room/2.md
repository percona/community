Surendar Munimohan - AWS - Amazon Aurora Community Track - Percona Live 2021

Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures (https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/), can have a large number of open connections to the database server, and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability. In this session, learn how to RDS Proxy can help reduce MySQL failover times by up to 66% and how to manage database credentials, authentication, and access through integration with AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
