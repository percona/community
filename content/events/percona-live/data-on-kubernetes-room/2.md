Dr Gavin Mendel - TerminusDb - Data on Kubernetes Track - Percona Live 2021

The talk does exactly what it says on the tin - everything you want to know about databases from somebody with decades of experience implementing, architecting, and building databases. Gavin will talk through the way he currently thinks about implementation - the problems he most cares about - and then will open up to your questions! In the absence of Stonebreaker, nobody is better placed to answer database Q&A.
