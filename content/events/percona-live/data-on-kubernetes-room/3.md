Anurag Gupta - Calyptia - Data on Kubernetes Track - Percona Live 2021

As more and more users move to Kubernetes they also may start using multiple backends and analytic tools. How do you collect once and send everywhere? In this talk, Anurag will talk about a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project Fluent Bit and how you can collect once, and send to all the backends you want. Additionally, Anurag will discuss some of Fluent Bit's advanced capabilities such as enrichment, parsing, and data reduction that helps users get the most out of their backends.
