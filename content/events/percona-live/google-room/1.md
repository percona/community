Eno Compton - Google - Percona Live 2021

There's a lot to like about Kubernetes and Cloud SQL, but it's not always clear how to use them together. This talk will be a deep-dive into Cloud SQL and how to work with it effectively on Kubernetes. The talk will be developer-centric and will start with the basics of connecting to Cloud SQL from Kubernetes. It will include how to run load tests and then size an instance. And, it will end with how to enable connection pooling to get the most out of Cloud SQL while having some fun along the way.
