Christoph Bussler and Shashank Agarwal - Google - Percona Live 2021

When you have an application running in Google Kubernetes Engine, there are multiple options and considerations for how to deploy a database. In this session, you'll learn some of the architectural considerations for choosing a database deployment option in GKE. We will demonstrate one of these options, as you learn how to configure PostgreSQL as a container in GKE based on regional persistent disks and PersistentVolumeClaims. Running PostgreSQL on regional persistent disks provides a RPO of zero in case of a zone outage and we will demonstrate how a failover takes place.
