Dipti Borkar (Ahana) and Tim Meehan (Facebook) - Presto Community Track - Percona Live 2021

Presto is an open source high performance, distributed SQL query engine. Born at Facebook in 2012, Presto was built to run interactive queries on large Hadoop-based clusters. Today it has grown to support many users and use cases including ad hoc query, data lake analytics, and federated querying. In this session, we will give an overview on Presto including architecture and how it works, the problems it solves, and most common use cases. We'll also share the latest innovation in the project as well as what's on the roadmap.
