Dipti Borkar (Ahana) and Gary Stafford (AWS) - Presto Community Track - Percona Live 2021

Presto, the fast-growing open source SQL query engine, disaggregates storage and compute and leverages all data within an organization for data-driven decision making. It is driving the rise of Amazon S3-based data lakes and on-demand cloud computing. In this session you'll learn how Ahana Cloud, the only managed service for Presto, simplifies Presto deployment & management on AWS using Kubernetes so data platforms teams of any size can use it.
