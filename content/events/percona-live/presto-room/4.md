Ariel Weisberg - Facebook - Presto Community Track - Percona Live 2021

Presto at Facebook has evolved significantly since its inception in 2012. In this session, Ariel will discuss this evolution including fundamental architectural improvements on scale and efficiency, the business cases that drive improvements like these, how the Presto use cases at Facebook have grown (and what they are), and how this all is balanced with features that the Presto community looks for. You'll learn how a company like Facebook thinks about Presto, how it can be used, and where it's going.
