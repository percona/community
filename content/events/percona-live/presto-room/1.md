Hemant Bhanawat - Yugabyte - Presto Community Track - Percona Live 2021

Presto Operator for Kubernetes is used to manage Presto clusters which are deployed as custom resources. In short, the task of configuring, creating and managing of Presto cluster(s) in a Kubernetes environment has been made simple, easy and quick with a Presto Operator.

This session will be a walkthrough of provisioning Presto in K8s using Presto Operator. The advanced features of Presto Operator like HTTPS support, additional volumes support, autoscaling and graceful shutdown of workers will also be discussed. Future work and areas where the community can contribute will be discussed too.
