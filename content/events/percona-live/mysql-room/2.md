Carsten Thalheimer - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021

Oracle MySQL Database Cloud Service 2021 - Where we are today...

Early 2020 Oracle introduced the MySQL Database Service (MDS) built on Oracle Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure and MySQL 8. It is 100% developed, managed, and supported by the Oracle MySQL team.
The service is available as a fully-managed service in all commercial regions of the Oracle Cloud. Customers do not need to deploy, patch, update, backup or restore a MySQL instance - all processes are covered as part of the Cloud operation.
Administrative tasks are pushed to the OCI web console and/or via the OCI Command line.
In this presentation we are looking into ways on how to “setup” a MySQL Instance and how to work with MySQL instances based on the GUI and the Command Line (OCI).
As part of this we are looking into the specifics of the available my.cnf / Configuration, CPU/Memory Shapes, Disk and Network options.
Furthermore, we are looking into typical usage scenarios like How to migrate MySQL data to the MDS, High Availability  Scenarios and How to congure Replication from anywhere to MDS.
The presentation includes a couple of small demos to showcase the usage of MySQL on an introduction level.
