Carsten Thalheimer - Oracle MySQL - MySQL Track Room - Percona Live 2021

Since 2020 the MySQL development team is offering a fully managed database service of the MySQL Enterprise Edition. Traditionally MySQL InnoDB is designed for online transaction processing (OLTP) load. MySQL can cover online analytics processing (OLAP) load, but it is often rather slow and tricky.
Beginning of December 2020, the MySQL team started a second MySQL Cloud offering called MySQL HeatWave for Real-time Analytics which is based on a new in-memory analytic accelerator which has been designed for extreme performance and cloud scale. This service provides a single, unified platform for both OLTP and OLAP workloads. It can scale to several hundreds of cores and provides around 400x speedup over MySQL for analytic workloads and enables scalable analysis over tens of terabytes of MySQL data. 2 of 4 Speakers Customers can now run all their OLTP and analytics workloads with MySQL without the need to move their data out of MySQL or without requiring any change to their application.
In this presentation we provide an overview about what is going on under the hood and will support our slides with a demo of the technology.
