Change is part of open source and it’s what drives progress!

As the **Redis** ecosystem evolves, new opportunities are emerging for developers and organizations that value transparency, freedom, and innovation.  

That’s why [Percona](https://www.percona.com/), together with AWS, is hosting **Open Source Unlocked: From Redis to Valkey**, a one-day, in-person event where you can explore how the community is reimagining in-memory databases with **Valkey**, the open source alternative to **Redis**.
