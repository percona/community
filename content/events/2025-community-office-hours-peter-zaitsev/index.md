## What This Talk Is About

In the early 2000s, MySQL was the default choice for new open-source projects. Fast-forward twenty years, and the landscape has dramatically changed: PostgreSQL has become the leader, earning the trust, adoption, and mindshare of developers across industries.
In this session, Peter will explore:
Why PostgreSQL surged in popularity
What contributed to MySQL’s relative decline
The technical and ecosystem differences that shaped this shift
Real trends he sees in the community and enterprise workloads
The challenges PostgreSQL must address to stay at the top
What the future might hold for both database worlds
Peter will share his practical insights from years of working closely with both MySQL and PostgreSQL communities, giving attendees a balanced and meaningful view of how these technologies continue to evolve.
