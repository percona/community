![Meetup](events/streams-monthly-dev/Monthly-Percona-Developer-pgpool.jpg)

Have you always wanted to know what and how a developer is working? What do they do, how do they start looking into issues and how do they finally turn that into code? It’s your time to get a behind the scenes view into the daily life of a developer from Percona! 

In this session, Muhammad Usama, one of the core contributors of pgpool, will be giving a brief overview of Pgpool-II, why and where it can and can't be used, and will be signing off with a bit on what's been happening in Pgpool-II community and how the future looks like.

Pgpool-II has been around to complement PostgreSQL for over a decade and provides many features like replication, connection pooling, failover, query caching, load balancing, and HA.
Because of its name for historical reasons, its use cases still need to be discovered and widely understood. This talk aims at shedding some light on Pgpool-II, its extensive feature set, and discussion about use cases where Pgpool-II is a good or not-so-good choice.

Finally, he will highlight some of the significant enhancement areas the community has been working on.
