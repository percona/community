![Percona Community Dev Monthly](events/streams-monthly-dev/Monthly-Percona-Developer-Meetup-Secure.jpg)

When we talk about database security, it encompasses different modules of different distinct areas. It is a very vast topic because it requires securing your (1) **Network**, (2) **Network Node**, (3) **Data**, (4) **Database**, (5) **Users** and (6) **Application**. 

A secure system or a database means it is secured by all means. The main pillars of security are **A(Authentication)**, **A (Authorization)**, and **A (Accounting)**. PostgreSQL provides different levels of security. Sometimes it takes effort to learn how to use different types of authentication, what it is and authorization, and how to do auditing and accounting. This talk will cover all the available security techniques used in PostgreSQL based on the AAA model. It will not only cover how to use that but as well as the pros and cons of all these methods. 

Securing the data over the wire and on disk is a key security feature, and PostgreSQL has that too. Therefore, we will cover network-level security and on-disk security. The talk will cover all these aspects, with some real-life use cases and examples.
