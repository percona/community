# Monthly Percona Developer Meetup

This new meetup is your chance to get a behind-the-scenes view and to **directly interact** in-person with our engineers. Jump into the session with the Restream link from the online chat during the event and share your thoughts with the audience!

We’ll discuss development practices, tools, projects, frameworks, and many more engineering-focused topics that we are working on at Percona. It will be fantastic!
