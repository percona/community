# Monthly Percona Developer Meetup

This new meetup is your chance to get a behind-the-scenes view and to **directly interact** in-person with our engineers. Jump into the session with the Restream link from the online chat during the event and share your thoughts with the audience!

Weâ€™ll discuss development practices, tools, projects, frameworks, and many more engineering-focused topics that we are working on at Percona. It will be fantastic!
