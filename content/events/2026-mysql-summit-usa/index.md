We’re gathering in **San Francisco** on **January 14** for a focused, in‑person summit dedicated to strengthening the MySQL ecosystem through collaboration and contribution.

- **Location:** 123 South Park St, San Francisco, CA 94107  
- **Attendance:** Free, by registration and confirmation only  
- **Format:** In‑person only, no remote participation  
- **Time:** Wednesday, January 14, 2026, from 9:00 to 17:00 PT  
- **Structure:** Roundtable discussions, peer connections, and collaboratively shaping the summit agenda  

## The Challenge

MySQL continues to be a critical part of global data infrastructure, powering applications and services at scale. Its long‑term health depends not only on a few companies but on coordinated effort across the broader community. Without active collaboration, contributors risk duplicating work, missing opportunities to improve reliability, and slowing innovation.  

## The Solution

This summit provides a space for engineers, contributors, and organizations who care about MySQL’s future to meet in person, share practical experience, and discuss how to collaborate more effectively. The focus is on technical exchange and community building — from performance and tooling to deployment practices and long‑term sustainability.  

## What Makes This Different

Most MySQL conferences are aimed at end users and focus on best practices. This summit is different: it is designed for **active contributors** to the MySQL ecosystem.  

We expect participation from:  
- Software vendors, tool builders, and service providers  
- Contributors to MySQL or its forks  
- Engineers and architects working with large‑scale MySQL deployments  
- Community organizers and open‑source advocates  
- Companies with significant MySQL infrastructure  

The goal is to have direct, technical discussions about how to support MySQL’s long‑term health. Diverse voices and practical experience are welcome to help shape that future.  

## Led by Vadim Tkachenko

The summit will be led by **Vadim Tkachenko**, co‑founder of Percona and a key figure in the MySQL world. Vadim served for many years as Percona’s CTO, contributed to the development of MySQL‑based products, and is a respected author and speaker in the open‑source database community. His deep technical expertise and long‑standing commitment to MySQL make him an ideal guide for this summit.

## Who You’ll Meet

We expect participation from engineers and contributors working on MySQL and its ecosystem, including developers from Percona and other MySQL‑focused teams.  

**Among the participants and speakers:**  

- **Sam Lambert** — CEO of PlanetScale. With a background in engineering leadership and open‑source advocacy, Sam has been guiding PlanetScale’s mission to bring scalable, developer‑friendly database solutions to the community. His perspective on building modern DBaaS platforms will add valuable insight to summit discussions.

- **Peter Zaitsev** — co‑founder of Percona and a long‑time leader in the MySQL community. A driving force behind open‑source database innovation, frequent speaker at global conferences, and advocate for collaborative development. His deep experience in MySQL performance, scalability, and community engagement will enrich the discussions and connections at the summit.
