## Join the Online Stream

Percona invites you to a Live Chat & Demo showcasing the **public prototype** of **JS stored programs** in Percona Server for MySQL! 

Learn about the architecture and inner workings of stored procedures that deliver execution speeds up to **100x faster** compared to traditional SQL-based procedures. Discover the current state of this feature, its architecture, practical applications, and security aspects.

Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers directly from the presenters and development team.

**Event Details:**  
📅 **Date:** April 14, 2025  
🕒 **Time:** 16:30 CEST / 14:30 GMT / 10:30 am ET  
🎥 **Platforms:** [LinkedIn Live](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7313171136282779649/comments/) and [YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2FNSMUnRz8)  

The session will be presented by **Marco Tusa**, MySQL Tech Lead at Percona, and **Dmitry Lenev**, Principal Software Engineer at Percona. They will discuss the architecture, current functionality, security measures, and practical use cases for JS stored programs in Percona Server for MySQL.

## What Is This About?

JS stored programs allow developers to use a familiar and flexible language to handle complex database logic.While Oracle has implemented JS stored programs in MySQL 9.0 (available only in Enterprise Edition), Percona is developing an open-source alternative, which will be integrated into Percona Server for MySQL. This implementation is based on the V8 JS engine, used in Node.js and Google Chrome.

The **public prototype** is available in Percona's GitHub repository ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/percona/percona-server/tree/js-lang)) for testing and feedback. It allows developers to:

- **Enhanced flexibility** for creating complex stored programs and workflows.  
- **Familiar syntax and ecosystem**, used by over 60% of developers worldwide in 2024.  
- **Significant performance benefits**, with JS routines delivering up to **100x faster execution** compared to traditional SQL-based procedures in benchmarks.

## Practical Use Cases

During the demo, the presenters will demonstrate examples of how JS stored programs can be applied in real-world scenarios, including:

- **Advanced JSON Processing:** Extracting nested fields, validating schemas, and transforming JSON data.  
- **Regex & Text Manipulation:** Using JavaScript's regex capabilities for tasks such as email normalization or pattern extraction.  
- **Custom Aggregations:** Creating weighted averages and statistical analyses.  
- **Financial Calculations:** Calculating loan payments or compound interest.  
- **Dynamic Query Generation:** Building and executing SQL queries programmatically.  

## What to Expect in the Demo?

- **Technical Overview:** A detailed explanation of the architecture and key capabilities of JS stored programs.
- **Security Considerations:** Discussion of sandboxing and other measures.
- **Q&A Session:** Engage directly with Percona engineers.

## Try It Yourself

The **public prototype** is available for testing in Percona's GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/percona/percona-server/tree/js-lang). Developers and database engineers are encouraged to try it and share their feedback to shape further enhancements.
