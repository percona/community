On November 15th, Percona organized a meetup with the local community in Ulyanovsk (Russia). From Percona, there were Peter Zaitsev (CEO), Maria Azizova (Staff Executive), and Aleksandra Abramova (Community Specialist). They had a chance to meet engineers from different IT companies who live nearby. 

The event took place in an interesting location. It was a private Balalaika's Museum. It is a Russian national musical instrument. If you wonder how it sounds like, there are some examples on YouTube like this one. Participants took beautiful pictures with collectible pieces and grab some Percona swag (stickers, cord organizers, and badges). 

Engineers discussed with Peter databases, Kubernetes as a modern trend and when you need to use it, pg_stat_monitor and other interesting themes.
