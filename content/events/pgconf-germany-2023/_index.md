The PGConf Germany 2023 took place in the [Haus der Technik](https://2023.pgconf.de/venue/) in Essen, Germany, on June 27, 2023. It had a record-breaking registration with above 250 people. 

The sessions weren’t recorded but many speakers added their slide decks to their talks, so check out the [schedule](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfde2023/schedule/) if you’re interested to learn more about a specific talk. 

Kai Wagner and Dimitri Vanoverbeke from Percona participated in the event and worked on Percona booth. It was the first time they met in-person! They took some time to walk around the city to learn each other better.

The day of the conference started with the preparation of the booth. We had some really nice swag to give away: bags, stickers and bottle openers.

During the day, our team had a lot of interesting and fruitful conversations. Many people were  interested in Percona support and services offerings.

All attendees who came to our booth had an opportunity to participate in a raffle and win a Raspberry Pi 4.

The event was organized well, the venue was nice and the attendees were super friendly, curious, and also interested to connect. 

After a long but also intense day, Kai and Dimitri were lucky to hang out across the board with community members from different companies.

We are already looking forward to the next event to get in touch!
