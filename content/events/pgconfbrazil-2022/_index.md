Percona supports events all over the globe. We were so happy to participate in a big (maybe even the largest!) Postgres event in Brazil - PGConf Brazil 2022. It is a world-class conference, which builds on the efforts of professionals and enthusiasts to expand the community of PostgreSQL, enabling participants to develop new knowledge through lectures and training. 

Since the pandemic has slowed down a bit and allowed all of us to gather together safely again, we take part in offline events again and this is super exciting.

Percona sponsored PGConf Brasil on a Silver level. Several wonderful Percona experts (Fernando Camargos, Charly Batista, Agustín Gallego, Leonardo Bacchi Fernandes, and Marcelo Altmann) travelled together to São José dos Campos, a city in southeast Brazil.

We prepared a booth to meet everyone interested in databases and open source technologies. PMM demo raised a big interest among attendees. People showed a lot of interest in PMM adoption. everyone had a chance not only to watch demo, but also talk to our experts and ask questions.

Percona staff members also gave several talks. All talks were well attended. 

* **Efficiently Deploying PostgreSQL Instances** by Agustín Gallego

  We will review how to deploy PostgreSQL environments and be able to have any version of PostgreSQL running within minutes... or even seconds! You will learn what cool tools the Percona Support team uses to efficiently deploy everything from standalone servers to more complex replication and HA topologies.

  After attending, you will have all the knowledge you need to start testing your applications against fully functional PostgreSQL instances... fast!

* **I Dropped My Database! Now What? - A Dive Into PostgreSQL Backup Using pgBackRest and How to Use It for PITR** by Charly Batista. 
  We live in a dangerous world and a catastrophe can happen at any time, including in our database. We can have a hardware failure, software failure, malicious software, or a human error and find ourselves with a data loss. While we work hard to prevent all those some are just not under our control and we cannot rely on luck, we need strategy and methods to be able to recover the maximum data we can in case a catastrophic event happens and this is what we will discuss during this talk. How to survive catastrophic events and recover data back!

* **Boosting performance with Window Functions and CTEs** by Charly Batista and Breno Baima (Vox Tecnologia)

  Window Functions and CTEs are extremely powerful features and few people use them extensively. Often due to lack of knowledge, other times because they do not realize the benefit they can have.

  A well-built query can have a significant performance gain just by reducing the number of calls the application makes to the Database and complex queries that would often be written as 2, 3 or more distinct queries can be rewritten into 1 single query using.

We also prepared nice gifts for the event attendees. Everyone could receive a piece of Percona swag: water bottles, mugs, pens, or stickers. The luckiest ones could participate in a drawing and win a Google Chromecast with Google TV!

Big thanks to all who were able to join this event. We love meeting new people and old friends virtually and in-person. I hope we will meet you too at the upcoming events!
