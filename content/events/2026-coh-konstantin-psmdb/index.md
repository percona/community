title: 'Securing MongoDB Data at Rest, Key Management with KMIP and Vault - March 17, 2026'
description: Konstantin Trushin walks through how Percona Server for MongoDB implements data-at-rest encryption, including the two-level key architecture, KMS integrations (KMIP servers and Vault/OpenBao), master key rotation, compromised-key handling via KMIP state polling, and how to avoid data-loss pitfalls with Vault versioned secrets.

Setting up data-at-rest encryption correctly requires more than just flipping a switch. In this session, **Konstantin Trushin** will explain how **Percona Server for MongoDB** implements this critical security layer, covering the two-level key architecture and integration with industry-standard Key Management Systems (KMS) such as **KMIP**-compatible servers and **HashiCorp Vault** (along with its open source alternative, **OpenBao**).

Participants will learn the mechanics of master key rotation, how the server handles compromised keys through KMIP state polling, and how to avoid potential data loss pitfalls when working with versioned secrets in Vault[cite: 29].
