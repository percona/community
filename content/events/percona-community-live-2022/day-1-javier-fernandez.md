ProxySQL has proven itself as the de-facto standard reverse proxy for MySQL, yet, we are always looking for new features and improvements. During this past year starting with v2.1.0, four new major ProxySQL versions were released, and with them new features of all sorts were introduced, ranging from protocol changes, authentication improvements, clustering improvements, new monitoring features (for Galera, Group Replication, Aurora AWS) to DDOS protection. Join us for a deeper dive on the details of these (and more) new features, what they have to offer and how you can get the most out of them.
