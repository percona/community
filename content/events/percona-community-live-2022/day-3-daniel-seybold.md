Understanding the performance of different databases is crucial for building efficient, data-intensive applications. Benchmarking possible databases is a valid option for enabling such comparison, yet, it is a major challenge due to heterogeneity in the resource, database, and workload level.

To enable an on-demand comparison of cloud-hosted databases, we present a database performance ranking as an open dataset that is created with the Benchmarking-as-a-Service platform benchANT. This ranking will be continuously extended to cover the latest advancements in the cloud resource, database, and benchmark domain.
