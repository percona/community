We live in a dangerous world and a catastrophe can happen at any time, including in our database. We can have a hardware failure, software failure, malicious software, or a human error and find ourselves with a data loss. While we work hard to prevent all those some are just not under our control and we cannot rely on luck, we need strategy and methods to be able to recover the maximum data we can in case a catastrophic event happens and this is what we will discuss during this talk. How to survive catastrophic events and recover data back!
