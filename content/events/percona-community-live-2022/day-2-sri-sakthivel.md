![Overview of Different ALTER Algorithms and Its Locking Scenarios in MySQL DEMO](events/percona-community-live/cards/Community-Live-Day-2-Sri-Sakthivel.jpg)

This session was presented on [Percona Community Live](/events/percona-community-live-2022/) Online June 21-23, 2022. Check out the full schedule [here](/events/percona-community-live-2022/).
