![Let's Talk About MySQL Query Tuning](events/percona-community-live/cards/Community-Live-Day-2-Gabriel-Ciciliani.jpg)

This session was presented on [Percona Community Live](/events/percona-community-live-2022/) Online June 21-23, 2022. Check out the full schedule [here](/events/percona-community-live-2022/).

Regardless of development frameworks, despite linters, besides countless sessions with the DBA, slow queries always end up making it to production. Proactive and reactive slow query tuning is still critical to ensure poorly written queries aren't undermining server performance and wasting valuable compute resources. Cloud-based database managed services are not the exception: slow query root cause analysis requires human intervention. In this session I will discuss why slow query tuning is more relevant than ever, how to detect problems and guidelines to fix them.
