This session is presented on [Percona Community Live](/events/percona-community-live-2022/) Online June 21-23, 2022. Check out the full schedule [here](/events/percona-community-live-2022/).

A common request that we get from our clients is to make MySQL highly available or to enhance existing architecture. We have standardized our approach by combining a proxy layer, for traffic redirection, a topology management tool, for master failover/switchover, and some additional tools to glue together both layers.
