![Database Reliability Engineering for MySQL](events/percona-community-live/cards/Community-Live-Day-2-Matthias-Crauwels.jpg)

This session was presented on [Percona Community Live](/events/percona-community-live-2022/) Online June 21-23, 2022. Check out the full schedule [here](/events/percona-community-live-2022/).

We have standardized our approach by combining a proxy layer, for traffic redirection, a topology management tool, for master failover/switchover, and some additional tools to glue together both layers.
