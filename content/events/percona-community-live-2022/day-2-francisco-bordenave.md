Now that you're using PMM to identify slow queries and chart your database activity, what PMM can do for you to avoid problems? PMM is getting more and more popular for monitoring databases while features are increasing and allowing us to do more with less effort. In this talk we will show you how PMM can help you on your day to day operational tasks to prevent issues by setting up alerts. Also we will show you how PMM can integrate with most popular pager tools like pager duty or slack.
