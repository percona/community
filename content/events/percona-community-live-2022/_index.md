Good news! We are happy to announce a new 100% virtual event coming up this summer - **Percona Community Live**! 

* Agenda is ready and published [here](#agenda)
* Links to the streaming [here](#watch-event-here)

It will take place on June 21-23 online and will be live-streamed on YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitch. It is an excellent opportunity to learn from the best-of-breed experts directly from your home! We will focus on the latest trends in the database world, and secret tricks from the open source stars.

We have so much great content on Percona Live this year (as usual, I should say). A lot of good speakers submitted talks, and we did not manage to find a slot for each excellent topic in the schedule. So we sat down and decided to run one more event! And we totally understand that travel is still challenging, thatâ€™s why it will be held virtually. All attendees will be able to ask their questions and chat on Discord. 

## Watch Event Here

The event will be live-streamed on several platforms. No registration is required. Feel free to ask your questions in chat. Follow the links now and subscribe to notifications not to miss anything!
