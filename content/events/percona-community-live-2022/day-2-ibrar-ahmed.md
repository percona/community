Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are intertwined capabilities that attempt to solve problems that defy traditional computational solutions --- problems including fraud detection, voice recognition, and search result recommendations. While they elude simple computation, they are computationally expensive, involving the calculation of perhaps millions of probabilities and weights. These computations can be done outside the database, but there are specific advantages of doing machine learning inside it, close to where the data is stored. This presentation explains how to do machine learning inside the Postgres database.
