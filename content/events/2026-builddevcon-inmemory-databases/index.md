Percona is taking part in the **DB Mastery: In-Memory Databases** summit on **March 20, 2026**. This virtual event focuses on how teams design and operate high-performance in-memory systems, covering low-latency data models, caching architectures, and scaling fast read/write workloads.

Percona will have a strong presence with four expert speakers contributing to the talks and discussions:

* **Peter Zaitsev** (Founder)
* **Andrey Glazkov**
* **Martin Visser**

The summit explores critical technical themes for modern high-throughput applications, including distributed clustering, durability patterns, and real-time event-driven patterns.

Attendees will dive into deep operational topics such as:
* **Durability strategies**: Snapshots, AOF, and hybrid persistence.
* **Architecture**: Clustering/sharding for distributed in-memory engines and HA/failover models.
* **Management**: Memory management, eviction policies, and security/access control.
* **Observability**: Monitoring and performance at very high resolution.

Percona is excited to join this global virtual gathering to share insights on building and maintaining ultra-low-latency database environments. Join us to learn from real-world use cases and technical experts!
