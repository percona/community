Percona invites developers and engineers to an **interactive technical session** on **building Valkey modules in Rust**, featuring **Dmitry Polyakovsky**, a recognized **author and speaker** on Valkey and Rust module development.  

Have you used **Valkey (or Redis)** but wished it had a specific feature?  
Have you looked at the Valkey code thinking you could add that feature, but felt intimidated by the complexity of the underlying C code?  

In this session, weâ€™ll explore how to **extend Valkey with custom features** by building a module from scratch. Weâ€™ll use **Rust** to take advantage of its memory safety and rich ecosystem, and leverage the **Valkey Modules Rust SDK** to speed up development.  

## **Event Details**  

ðŸ“… **Date:** June 16, 2025  
ðŸ•’ **Time:** 1:00 PM Pacific Time / 8:00 PM GMT  
ðŸŽ¥ **Platforms:** [LinkedIn Live](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7334205388193464321/comments/) and [YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m_zmjEPClE)

## **Speakers & Host**  

- **Speaker:** **Dmitry Polyakovsky** â€“ Consulting Member of Technical Staff, Oracle; **author and speaker on Valkey modules in Rust**  
- **Host:** **Lori Lorusso** â€“ Head of Community, Percona  

## **Whatâ€™s This About?** 

Valkey is a high-performance in-memory database that supports extensibility through modules. This session will cover the **Valkey Modules Rust SDK**, which enables developers to create custom commands and data types without modifying Valkeyâ€™s core.  

## **Key Topics**  
- **Architecture of the Valkey Modules Rust SDK**  
- **Writing modules without unsafe code**  
- **New SDK features: client APIs, authentication, preload validation**  
- **Practical examples and implementation insights**  

## **What to Expect in the Demo**  
- **SDK Overview:** How Rust simplifies Valkey module development  
- **Hands-on Implementation:** Dmitry Polyakovsky will demonstrate module creation  
- **Code Examples:** Working with clients, command filtering, event handling  
- **Q&A:** Ask questions directly to the speakers  

If you work with Rust and want to dive deeper into Valkey module development, donâ€™t miss this session!
