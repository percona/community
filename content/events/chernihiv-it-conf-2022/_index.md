Percona sponsored an amazing event organized by Chernihiv.IT Cluster - Chernihiv.IT Conf: Tech Front. It was an online event organized in support to Chernihiv and IT industry in this city. It was an online event and it attackted a lot of attendees from Chernihiv and all over Ukraine. 

Evgeniy Patlan, Manager in Build & Release Engineering, was in the role of the host greeting speakers, communicating with them and asking questions.

As Evgeniy was the host, he gave no talks. Combining both roles would have been challenging, wouldn't it? But other speakers from Percona participated in the event. 

Lenz Grimmer presented his talk **Managing Remote Team**. Lenz started his first job in a fully remote company when joining MySQL AB in 2002. Since then, he has worked remotely for various software companies of different sizes. He moved from an individual contributor role into becoming an engineering team lead and, later, director of engineering of distributed teams.

In this presentation, Lenz talked about some key elements that he has learned about that are essential for creating and leading successful remote teams. That is definitely his passion.

Also, Peter Zaitsev (Percona's CEO) talked about **Better MySQL with Percona Monitoring and Management**.

Optimizing MySQL performance, troubleshooting MySQL problems, and managing backups are the most critical and challenging tasks for MySQL DBAs in their daily routine. The databases powering your applications need to be able to handle changing traffic workloads while remaining responsive and stable so that you can deliver an excellent user experience. At the same time, modern database vendors demonstrate a trend of moving away from traditional deployment methods to DBaaS, which means DBAs are also expected to find cost-efficient means of solving these issues.
