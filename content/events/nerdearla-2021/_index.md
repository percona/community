One of the virtual events Percona was happy to support this year was Nerdearla 2021, the most important IT conference in the Latin American region. 

Ivan Groenewold (Architect, Percona) presented his talk “Deployando MongoDB sharded con Terraform y Ansible” (Deploying MongoDB Sharded Clusters With Terraform and Ansible”.

We also welcomed people to our virtual booth and distributed some white paper collateral. 

Though it was lots of fun virtually, we hope that in the future we will be able to meet in person again!
