Percona is proud to be a **Silver Sponsor** of **Kubecon Europe 2026**, one of the most important gatherings for the cloud native and open source ecosystem. The event will take place from **March 23-26, 2026**, at the **RAI Amsterdam** in the Netherlands.

KubeCon Europe brings together practitioners, contributors, and maintainers from around the world to share knowledge and shape the future of Kubernetes and related technologies. As a flagship conference of the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**, it features collaboration across Graduated, Incubating, and Sandbox projects.

* **Open source databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
* **Kubernetes** and cloud native data management
