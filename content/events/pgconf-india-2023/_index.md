PGConf India 2023 started on a fresh note after 2 years of gap due to the pandemic. With 400+ conference attendees and 150+ attendees for the training program, it was a great event.

There were three parallel tracks for the presentations. **Jobin Augustine**, PostgreSQL Escalation Specialist from Percona, gave 2 talks during the event: 

* [Reducing PostgreSQL Costs in the Cloud](https://pgconf.in/conferences/pgconfin2023/program/proposals/355)
In the face of economic uncertainty and a possible recession, many companies are trimming expenses, freezing hiring, and, in some cases, laying off staff.
But what if you could cut costs without negatively impacting resources or headcount? Better yet, what if you could free up enough budget to keep your existing staff and hire the quality candidates your team needs?

* [Highly Effective Troubleshooting of Performance and Stability Problems in a PostgreSQL Server](https://pgconf.in/conferences/pgconfin2023/program/proposals/256)
Have you ever been in a database emergency and needed real quick pinpointing information on what is wrong with a PostgreSQL instance/database?
Are you looking for a good Analysis and meaningful conclusions using the data presented by PostgreSQL performance views (pg_stat_*)
Have you ever felt that there is too much performance and monitoring data and how to make sense of that? If the answer is "Yes" for any or all of these, this is a presentation for you.
