There’s a lot of discussion about comparing Kubernetes operators for Postgres, but what about how Postgres operators compare to operators for other databases?

Percona builds operators for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, which gives our engineering and product teams a unique view into what can (and can’t) be shared across approaches for different DBMS. Join us for a live discussion on what we’ve learned and why some design choices must be different.
