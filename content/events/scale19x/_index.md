This July, Percona Team met in Los Angeles. We participated in the [Scale 19x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x) from July 28th to 31st. SCaLE is the largest community-run open-source and free software conference in North America. It is held annually in the greater Los Angeles area. It was a big event with many sponsors this year.

Percona sponsored the event on the Silver level and had a huge presence there. 5 experienced Percona experts gave several talks:

* [PostgreSQL and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/postgresql-and-artificial-intelligence) by Ibrar Ahmed (Principal Developer). 

* [Query Optimization 101 in MySQL](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/query-optimization-101-mysql) by Matthew Boehm (Senior Architect).

* [Forward to the Past: Point in Time Recovery for MySQL](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/forward-past-point-time-recovery-mysql) and [I Need Some (MySQL) Backup!](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/i-need-some-mysql-backup) By Pep Pla (Consultant).

* [MySQL Indexes](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/mysql-indexes) by Dave Stokes (Technical Evangelist).

And there were also three talks by the wonderful Matt Yonkovit (HOSS):

* [The Lost Art of Database Design](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/lost-art-database-design)

* [The 10 Deadly PostgreSQL Sins That Ruin Database Performance and Scalability](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/10-deadly-postgresql-sins-ruin-database-performance-and-scalability)

* [Application Design Parables: What Real Life Teaches us about Proper Application Design](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/application-design-parables-what-real-life-teaches-us-about-proper)

That’s a lot!

All the talks attracted many people and the conference surprised us with very good attendance, although the total number of people was ⅓ of the previous pre-COVID events. Almost every room's capacity is 60 people with multiple parallel talks, which were 70% full in many cases. Talks were recorded and published on the official [Southern California Linux Expo YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/socallinuxexpo/videos). 

We were also pleased to welcome attendees to the Percona booth and give them some nice gifts, good database advice, or both! Look at those pins, they are super cute, aren’t they?

And stickers!

Our tradition is to bring a custom-built Yonk box to our booth on events whenever possible - an arcade controller that allows you to manage database workloads in real-time and play with them in [Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management). Everyone can play with it and watch how the database behaves under changing workloads. 

P.S. The code for the Yonk box is open to everyone on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheYonk/os-db-json-tester).
