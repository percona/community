On April 20th, 2024, people who love working with databases came together in Cyprus for something special - the Percona University Limassol. Percona put on this event to help folks dive deep into the latest database tech.

The meetup was all about sharing knowledge. Percona brought in international and local experts in a database space. These experts talked about the newest trends, best ways to manage databases, and cool new solutions. Everyone could learn from each other and make connections with others who love databases.
