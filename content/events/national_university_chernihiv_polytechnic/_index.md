The mission of the National University "Chernihiv Polytechnic" is the development of society through education and research to build leadership and address global challenges in a changing world. It is a worthy flagship of higher education in Ukraine, a real forge for training highly qualified professionals ready to give their knowledge and strength development of the native state.

Evgeniy was not alone there but with active community members from different IT companies. They organized a panel discussion on the up-to-date IT trends with Q&A. Students willingly asked questions about the future of the IT technology sphere and up-to-date opportunities.

On the 29th of October, Evgeniy and one of the Percona engineers will also take part in the public lecture “What is DevOps?"
