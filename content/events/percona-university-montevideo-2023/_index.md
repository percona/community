This time agenda included talks both in English and Spanish:

* [Cloud of Serfdom vs Cloud of Freedom: Why Open Source Will Win in the Cloud Age](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k9Fd5jSxlGYpnbTgpBiuP-7XCt4SzVIk/view?usp=sharing) by Peter Zaitsev (Founder, Percona)

  Cloud and Open Source have a very intricate relationship! In this talk we will look at the history of how the impact of Cloud on Open Source changed through the years, examine the current state as well as make a case for a particular way to use Cloud and Open Source Together. If you cherish the values of Open Source - you will do well by using Cloud as Commodity Infrastructure Provider and run Open Source Software on top of it. Consider Kubernetes in particular as your API of choice with its ubiquitous availability among all major public cloud providers and private cloud software vendors. We will show what while this ecosystem may not be as mature as proprietary solution from cloud vendors it is moving rapidly and becoming a great fit for more and more situations.

* [PostgreSQL Parametrization Hints and Optimization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8YZVjRjNSgT7OPzAoffxihFGMABvMRC/view?usp=sharing) by Agustín Gallego (Senior Support Engineer, Percona)

  Is your PostgreSQL cluster underperforming even when running on a large server? Are you running with IO saturation? Is your memory under pressure? Is the CPU load too high? PostgreSQL was designed to run almost everywhere. That flexibility provided out of the box represents a challenge for those running PostgreSQL on large servers and intensive workloads. Finding the proper parametrization in your system could be challenging: it requires knowledge, continuous monitoring, and tuning according to the workload changes. This session will explore the essential aspects of PostgreSQL parametrization and OS-related parametrization. It will provide insights into what should be monitored and how to modify configurations accordingly. After completing this session, you can boost your PostgreSQL cluster performance, effectively and consistently.

  A common pattern in modern distributed systems is to share resources (e.g. databases) between two types of load-inducing processes: user-facing, steady state processes (typically web applications) and batch, bulk processing (typically asynchronous).
