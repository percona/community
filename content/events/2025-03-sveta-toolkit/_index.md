### About the Event

We invite you to join our online stream, perfect for developers, DBAs, and anyone interested in databases and the latest advancements in MySQL and Percona Toolkit.

Sveta is an expert in MySQL and Percona Toolkit, an accomplished author, and a speaker at international conferences on development and databases.

During the stream, Sveta will share her insights and experiences from the recent updates in MySQL, specifically focusing on the removal of offensive replication statements like START/STOP SLAVE.
