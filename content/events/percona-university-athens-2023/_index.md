Agenda includes talks from industry experts:

* **Cloud of Serfdom vs Cloud of Freedom: Why Open Source Will Win in the Cloud Age** by Peter Zaitsev (Founder, Percona)
  Cloud and Open Source have a very intricate relationship! In this talk we will look at the history of how the impact of Cloud on Open Source changed through the years, examine the current state as well as make a case for a particular way to use Cloud and Open Source Together. If you cherish the values of Open Source - you will do well by using Cloud as Commodity Infrastructure Provider and run Open Source Software on top of it. Consider Kubernetes in particular as your API of choice with its ubiquitous availability among all major public cloud providers and private cloud software vendors. We will show what while this ecosystem may not be as mature as proprietary solution from cloud vendors it is moving rapidly and becoming a great fit for more and more situations.

* **22 Reasons to Migrate to MySQL 8** by Peter Zaitsev (Founder, Percona)
  MySQL 8 is different from previous major MySQL versions, because MySQL 8 in 2023 is significantly different from MySQL 8 initial release in 2018, because many features are introduced in the minor version released since. In this presentation we will look at those most important Modern MySQL 8 features which appeared since the initial MySQL 8 release.

* **Moving MongoDB Workloads to Postgres with FerretDB** by Peter Farkas (Co-founder & CEO, FerretDB)
  MongoDB, a widely used database, has garnered both love and hate from its users across different industries due to its ease of use. However, it is no longer open source, faces licensing issues, and requires additional resources and knowledge to run. Is there a viable alternative? Can we move existing MongoDB workloads to Postgres without any application-level changes? How can we ensure MongoDB users can continue to use their tools and frameworks? In this talk, we will discuss the current state of document databases and why there is a need for a new open source standard. We propose that Postgres should serve as the database backend for this standard. We will also demonstrate how to equip your Postgres database with FerretDB, enabling it to handle MongoDB workloads. Finally, we will showcase some MongoDB tools that can be used to manage the database just like if it would be MongoDB. This use case connects Postgres with a different community and workloads.

* **Introduction to TiDB** by Mattias Jonsson (Senior Database Engineer, PingCAP)
  
* **PostgreSQL Object Oriented Concepts Applied to Real Business Problems** by Achilleas Mantzios (DBA, Open Source Projects)

* **MySQL 5.7 Goes EOL. How to Upgrade to MySQL 8** by Ananias Tsalouchidis (Principal DBA, Percona)
  MySQL 5.7 goes End of Life. No matter if you still have any kind of extended support or you are not going to upgrade right now, you will soon need to migrate to MySQL 8.x . This is a major project that you will need to carefully handle. During this session i'll try to present the best practises that will ensure a smooth migration from MySQL 5.7 to 8.x

* **Cloud Native MongoDB: Building a scalable MongoDB infrastructure** by Takis Stathopoulos (Enterprise Architect, Percona)
  The cost of running a growing enterprise-grade MongoDB environment on the Cloud can quickly get out of control. To make things worse, there are multiple traps awaiting. Factors and settings that initially do not seem important, at scale can significantly impact your spending.

* **Making a Career out of Open Source** by Peter Zaitsev (Founder, Percona)
  Are you thinking about taking your Open Source passion and making it into a career? What options do you have and how can you approach them? In this talk, we will cover the main choices you have - getting hired by the company which contributes to the Open Source project you love, Being a freelancer/starting Open Source consulting business or turning Open Source project into Open Source product and building a product business.
