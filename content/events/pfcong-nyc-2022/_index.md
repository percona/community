The [PostgreSQL NYC](https://2022.pgconf.nyc/) is a PostgreSQL community conference that was held in the last week of September 2022. It is a non–profit, community-run conference. About 140+ attendees participated in the event. Percona supported the conference on a Broze level and also provided additional support, for example, sponsoring speaker/stuff dinner.

Two speakers from Percona gave amazing talks: 

- **A Deep Dive Into PostgreSQL Indexing** by Ibrar Ahmed. 

*Abstract:*
Indexes are a fundamental feature of relational databases, and PostgreSQL offers developers and designers a rich collection of options. To take advantage of these entirely, users need to understand the basic concept of indexes to compare the different index types and apply them to different application scenarios. Only then can you make an informed decision about your database index strategy and design. One thing is for sure: not all indexes are appropriate for all circumstances, and using a ‘wrong’ index can have the opposite effect to what you intend, and problems might only surface once in production. Armed with more advanced knowledge, you can avoid this worst-case scenario! We’ll take a look at how to use pg_stat_statment to find opportunities for adding indexes to your database. We’ll look at when to add an index, and when adding an index is unlikely to result in a good solution. So should you add an index to every column? Come and discover why this strategy is rarely recommended as we take a deep dive into PostgreSQL indexing.

- **PostgreSQL Replication Conflicts: Avoiding Pitfalls** by Hamid Akhtar. 

*Abstract:*
Experiencing replication conflicts is not too unfamiliar a sight. Whether one experiences replication lag, slots, locks, snapshots, tablespace issues, or other conflicts, establishing a set of best practices along with using proper observability tools will help avoid potential issues. This talk focuses on what to do and what not to in order to avoid database conflicts in streaming replication setups by providing deep insight into how issues are PostgreSQL internals.

There were around 12 companies counters, including EnterpriseDB, Fijitso and Amazon. Percona was not represented with the booth but we sponsored veru nice coffee sleeves on the coffee stations for attendees.
