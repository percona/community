Percona Team actively participated in [FOSDEM 2021](https://fosdem.org/2021/). It is a large, non-commercial free event for thousands of developers of free and open-source software from all over the world to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Traditionally held in the beautiful city of Brussels (Belgium), it took place online this year on February 6-7. FOSDEM is widely recognized as the best such conference in Europe organized by the community for the community.

Tracks were grouped into devrooms. Devrooms are a place for teams to discuss, hack and publicly present the latest directions, lightning talks, news, and discussions. Percona speakers gave 13 presentations in 10 rooms this year.
