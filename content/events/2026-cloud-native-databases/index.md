Join Percona as it sponsors the Cloud Native Databases virtual event on February 20–21, 2026, featuring insights from key Percona leaders and engineers. Founder Peter Zaitsev, Software Engineer Ege Gunes, and Software Engineer George Kechagias will take the stage to share their perspectives and real‑world experience, highlighting how Percona’s open source services and tools empower teams to build, run, and scale modern database platforms with confidence in cloud environments.

- 📅 **February 20-21, 2026**
- 📍 **Virtual**
- 🔗 **Official website:** https://buildevcon.com/cloud-native-databases/

During the summit, Peter, Ege, and George will help attendees reimagine how modern data systems are deployed and operated. Moving beyond traditional hardware‑centric approaches, they will explore how cloud‑native architectures leverage automation, containers, and orchestration to achieve faster scaling, greater resilience, and reduced operational overhead—along with practical best practices for running flexible, cloud‑ready databases at scale. The Percona team is looking forward to engaging with you, sharing ideas, and learning together throughout the event.
