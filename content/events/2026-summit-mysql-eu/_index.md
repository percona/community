We're gathering in **Brussels** on **February 2nd** for a focused, in-person summit dedicated to strengthening the MySQL ecosystem through collaboration, contribution, and community building.

-   Location: Rue Auguste Orts, Grand Place 3-7, 1000 Bruxelles, Belgium

-   Attendance: Free, by registration and confirmation only

-   Format: In-person only, no remote participation

-   Time: Monday, February 2, 2026, at 10:30 Brussels Time (CET) / 09:30 GMT

-   Structure: Roundtable discussions, connecting with peers, and collaboratively creating the summit agenda.

## The Challenge

MySQL remains a critical part of the global data infrastructure, powering countless applications and services. Yet its long-term vitality depends on active, coordinated effort from the broader community, not just a few stakeholders.

## The Solution

This summit offers a space for individuals and organizations who care deeply about MySQL's future to come together, share ideas, and explore how we can collaborate more effectively. 

If you're part of the MySQL community, building tools, contributing code, supporting users, or working in DevRel, your voice and experience are essential.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike traditional MySQL conferences that focus on end users and best practices, this summit is designed for active contributors to the MySQL ecosystem. That includes:

-   Software vendors, tool builders, and service providers

-   Contributors to MySQL or its forks

-   Engineers and architects working with large-scale MySQL deployments

-   Community organizers and open-source advocates

-   Companies with significant MySQL infrastructure

Together, we'll explore how to support MySQL's long-term health, and we welcome diverse voices to help shape that future.

## Led by Vadim Tkachenko

The summit will be led by **Vadim Tkachenko**, co‑founder of Percona and a key figure in the MySQL world. Vadim served for many years as Percona’s CTO, contributed to the development of MySQL‑based products, and is a respected author and speaker in the open‑source database community. His deep technical expertise and long‑standing commitment to MySQL make him an ideal guide for this summit.

## Who You’ll Meet

We expect participation from engineers and contributors working on MySQL and its ecosystem, including developers from Percona and other MySQL‑focused teams. This is a unique opportunity to connect directly with the people building the tools, infrastructure, and community around MySQL.

**Among the participants and speakers:**

* **Mykola Marzhan** — Director of Engineering / Data Platform at Canonical. An engineering leader with 20 years of experience in database cluster management, managed services, monitoring, backups, and automated deployment systems. With a longstanding love of MySQL, he is focused on building the best DBaaS Platform.

* **Peter Zaitsev** — co‑founder of Percona and a long‑time leader in the MySQL community. A driving force behind open‑source database innovation, frequent speaker at global conferences, and advocate for collaborative development. His deep experience in MySQL performance, scalability, and community engagement will enrich the discussions and connections at the summit.

## Agenda

The agenda will be published during the first week of January. It will include the schedule of the day (10:30–17:00), the topics of collaborative discussions, and the planned breaks.

Expect a full day of interactive sessions with a flexible structure shaped by the participants, ensuring both focused conversations and time for networking.
