Percona Team members visited [Merge Conf 2021](https://mergeconf.ru/) in Innopolis, Russia, on November 13-14. 

Percona speakers gave 2 talks on the Open Source track.

1. Technologies and Trends in the World of Open Source Databases in 2021 by Peter Zaitsev (CEO, Percona). 
Peter talked about all the main open source databases and their versatility, considered specific solutions for different situations and provided information on the changes in open source licenses and what can be expected next year.

2. How to Avoid the Open Source Trap by Maria Azizova (Staff Executive to CEO, Percona). 
As open source becomes stronger on the market, we often see companies advertising their software as open source, even if it doesn't provide all the benefits that truly open source software has. In this presentation, Maria looked at some of the common pitfalls - different ways of using the term open source to describe software that doesn't conform to open source principles - and give tips on how to work with it and benefit from it.

The sessions were well-attended and raise a lot of interest among attendees. They asked actively asked questions and communicated with Peter and Maria.

The conference took place at the [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) focused on education and research in the field of IT and Robotics. It is located in the town built especially for the IT specialists near the big city Kazan on the river Volga. In Innopolis, a unique environment has been created that combines a modern residential infrastructure in harmony with nature, a safe environment, and broad opportunities for education and professional development. 

Many Russian IT companies had booths on the conference with swag giveaways and consultants who familiarized students and participants with the work of their companies. 

Speakers and company representatives also had a chance to visit Techoparks with a guided tour and find out more about the history of the town and the life of its citizens.
