David Zhao (ZettaDB) has been working on database kernels for years, developing code and enhancements for Berkeley DB, MySQL, and TDSQL. David is back with a new Hybrid database called Kunlun which aims to take the best of what's in the PostgreSQL and MySQL space both and output a better database. David sits down with Matt Yonkovit (The HOSS) to talk about the Kunlun project, distribution, implementation, scalability, and more.
