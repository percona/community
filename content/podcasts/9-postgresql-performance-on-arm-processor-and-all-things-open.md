title: "PostgreSQL Performance on the ARM processor and All Things Open - Percona Podcast 09"
description: "The HOSS sat down with Jobin and talked about not only Jobin’s journey into the PostgreSQL space, but also the benchmarks, PostgreSQL features, and all things Open."
short_text: "Last year AWS announced ARM-based Graviton2 EC2 instances providing a cheaper more efficient option to classic X86 instances. Jobin and Sergey Kuzmichev wanted to know if the cheaper instances came at a cost in overall performance and set out on a deep dive into benchmarking and testing the different instances. Their hard work culminated in the first of a potential group of blogs highlighting the performance of PostgreSQL on the ARM processor. The HOSS sat down with Jobin and talked about not only Jobin’s journey into the PostgreSQL space, but also the benchmarks, PostgreSQL features, and all things Open."
