title: "Impact of the War in Ukraine on the PostgreSQL Community – HOSS Talks FOSS 68 With Bruce Momjian"
description: "Catching up with Bruce on all things Open Source and PostgreSQL"
short_text: "Bruce and the Hoss catch up on all things Open Source and PostgreSQL.  They talk about the impact of the war in Ukraine on the PostgreSQL community & the rise of protest ware in open source.  Matt and Bruce also jump into the impact of end user/developers feelings towards databases in general on the future of PostgreSQL development.  Some developers care about databases but don’t have time, but there are others who don’t care. How do we involve both of these groups and inspire them?  Will derivative projects based on PostgreSQL help or hinder this effort?  Tune in and hear our thoughts."
