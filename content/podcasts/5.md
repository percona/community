Join Percona’s HOSS (Head of Open Source Strategy) Matt Yonkovit as he sits down with David Murphy to talk about his journey and how he is seeing the DBA position evolve into DBRE’s and SRE’s. David has recently been working on helping a major airline modernize its internal database management systems and infrastructure, bringing more of a DevOps and SRE mentality to the company. He will discuss some of the issues and trends he has seen in his role.  Covering multiple databases (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB) and multiple clouds is never easy, we talk about why keeping control of your data is so important, and how companies can enable developers to move faster by removing the database basics as a bottleneck.
