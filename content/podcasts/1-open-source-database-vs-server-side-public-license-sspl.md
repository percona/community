short_text: "On this episode of the HOSS (Head of open Source Strategy) talks FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), we talk with Peter Zaitsev CEO of Percona. We explore the changing landscape of the open source space including recent increases in the use of SSPL licenses by database providers like Elastic. We explore the trends driving the open source business in 2021. 


Last week Elastic announced that they were “Doubling Down” on open source by changing their licensing to a non-open license - MongoDB’s Server Side Public License or SSPL. Let me clarify in my opinion this is not doubling down - unless, as our good friend @gabidavila highlighted, that maybe the thinking was a double negative makes a positive? VM Brasseur posted on her blog that he feels Elastic and Kibana are now a business risk for enterprises. Peter Zaitsev has penned why he felt SSPL was bad for you before this announcement, and then sat down with me to discuss his thoughts last week as well. 


Elastic was the most recent company to change licenses away from a more permissive and open license following in the footsteps of other vendors like MongoDB. Is SSPL (Server Side Public) License good or bad? What is the impact on open source? Why the change?"
