MariaDB 10.3 however actually has some very interesting features that users do get excited about.
So that&amp;rsquo;s great!
My session at Percona Live Europe in Frankfurt is going to be best for people deploying MariaDB or related infra, who haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to explore what the various features actually mean, or what they can do with them.</description></item></channel></rss>
