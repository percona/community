Abstract MySQL&amp;rsquo;s sweet spot is known to be online transaction processing (OLTP), and it can support a very high load of short transactions. Many users will also want to run analytical queries (OLAP) on their MySQL data. Often they achieve this by exporting their data to another database system that is tailored for analytical queries.</description></item><item><title>Percona Live Presents: The MySQL Query Optimizer Explained Through Optimizer Trace</title><link>https://percona.community/blog/2019/04/24/mysql-query-optimizer-explained-optimizer-trace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 16:16:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://percona.community/blog/2019/04/24/mysql-query-optimizer-explained-optimizer-trace/</guid><description>During my presentation at Percona Live 2019 I will show how using Optimizer Trace can give insight into the inner workings of the MySQL Query Optimizer. Through the presentation, the audience will both be introduced to optimizer trace, learn more about the decisions the query optimizer makes, and learn about the query execution strategies the query optimizer has at its disposal. I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering the main phases of the MySQL optimizer and its optimization strategies, including query transformations, data access strategies, the range optimizer, the join optimizer, and subquery optimization.</description></item></channel></rss>
